      <description>&lt;p&gt;Institute of Geography and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start of employment: 01.09.2024 (latest)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary employment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our group&lt;/strong&gt; for Geocomputation and Earth Observation develops new model and data integration methods to gain a mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems, water-carbon coupling, and forest responses to climate change. We are hosted at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern, and work at the intersection of Earth system science, ecophysiology, ecology, applied statistics, and high-performance computing. Within the Virtual Earth Systems Research Insitute project LEMONTREE (Land Ecosystem Models based On New Theory, obseRvations, and ExperimEnts), we are recruiting a PhD student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;  This project will tackle one of the major sources for uncertainty in climate and Earth system projections reliable predictions of how water and nutrients govern vegetation, carbon and water cycling, and their responses to a changing climate and CO2. The aim is to integrate eco-evolutionary optimality theory and observational constraints into a dynamic model for simulating global land ecosystem functioning and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;  You will innovate towards a next-generation vegetation model by combining improved ecosystem process understanding and first principles, numerical modelling, and model-data integration methods. Your work will extend the model developed and maintained in our group, integrating novel theory development by the LEMONTREE project partners. You will apply the model for testing novel theory against different observational data, including satellite remote sensing observations, ecosystem flux data, and ecosystem manipulation experiments. The PhD will be designed to maintaining intellectual freedom to refine project directions. Your work will generate improved predictive methods for climate change impacts in land ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;  The candidate must hold a MSc degree in natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering and should demonstrate proficient English written and oral skills and excellent analytical and numerical skills. Experience with programming and other data science methods are an asset and an open and collaborative mentality for the development of our computational infrastructure is expected. The latest starting date for the PhD project is September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We offer&lt;/strong&gt; the candidate to be part of a small group with a strong collaborative philosophy and to benefit from a leading academic environment, from an international collaboration within the project and from the excellent quality of life in Switzerland. This PhD will be placed within the Graduate School of Climate Sciences at Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR) and will draw on supervisory expertise and that bridges ecosystem science, hydrology, vegetation modelling, and climate science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further information&lt;/strong&gt; about our group please visit Geco-group.org. Questions regarding the position should be directed to Prof. B. Stocker by email: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:benjamin.stocker@unibe.ch&#34;&gt;benjamin.stocker@unibe.ch&lt;/a&gt; (no applications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interested?&lt;/strong&gt;  We look forward to receiving your online application including the following documents: Motivation letter (max. 2 pages, with a statement of research interests), a CV, copies of academic qualifications and the names and e-mail addresses of three referees. Please submit your application before 31 May 2024 to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:geco.bern@gmail.com&#34;&gt;geco.bern@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; with the subject &amp;lsquo;geco-002&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Greenness of Swiss Forests</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/project/greenness_chforests/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 13:50:03 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will develop an anomaly detection of the “greenness” of forests in Switzerland. Greenness is monitored by satellites and reflects the impacts of climate extremes (droughts, frost, storm, etc.). Detecting where and when climate extremes lead to vegetation stress and anomalous leaf senescence (browning) is challenging. Earth observation data captures these effects, but extracting information from the large and noisy data is challenging. However, the sheer volume of the data, combined with complementary geodata, enables novel machine learning-based methods to be applied for the task. This project explores new solutions and find answers for an important task - mapping and quantifying impacts by climate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is funded as a &lt;em&gt;Swiss Data Science Center-University of Bern Pilot Project&lt;/em&gt; and is supported by Dr. Michele Volpi (SDSC) and David Brüggemann (SDSC).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make geospatial data with a time dimension into a tidy format</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/map2tidy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 15:22:44 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geospatial data often has a time dimension. Such temporal geospatial data often comes in the form of multiple files that contain the data of a single time step - in the form of a geospatial map - or in the form of files that each contain the data of a subset of the time steps. This is a problem for analyses and modelling that rely on having access to the whole time series data. To obtain the whole time series, we have to read all files into memory and then run the analyses. In practice, this is often not possible due to memory limitations. What can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to open each file, read a subset of the data, close the file, and open the next one and &amp;ldquo;stitch&amp;rdquo; the data together along the time axis. Then, repeat this to read the remaining subsets of the data to finally have time series of all geospatial units (usually pixels). This creates a burdensome computational overhead and involves lots of programming. Especially if the analyses are to be carried out in parallel for the spatial units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://geco-bern.github.io/map2tidy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;{map2tidy}&lt;/a&gt; R package solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;map2tidy&lt;/code&gt; of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://geco-bern.github.io/map2tidy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;{map2tidy}&lt;/a&gt; R package takes a vector of file names (full paths) of NetCDF files containing geospatial data and returns a tidy data frame where each row represents one pixel of the geospatial (raster) data and the complete time series of each pixel is contained as a nested data frame in the column &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. This is solved in R with the code below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;map2tidy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;dplyr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Global N uptake</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/nuptake_yunke/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having good estimates for the global total annual nitrogen (N) uptake by plants is important because it tells us how much N is cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We want to know this for example for putting the human perturbation of the global N cycle into context or as a target for models of the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, the amount of N taken up by plants is practically impossible to measure in the field. We therefore took an indirect approach to estimating this quantity. By knowing the annual total biomass production, the N content of new biomass, and the amount of N retained by plants when they shed their leaves (resorbing N causes leaves to turn yellow in autumn). We gathered these data from a large number of individual published field studies and complemented previously published data compilations. We further accounted for how these observed variables vary globally in relation to the environment. Based on the resulting models, we scaled each of these components (biomass production, N content, and resorption) to obtain global maps and then combined them to calculate the N uptake flux - across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important finding, apart from the numbers (global total N uptake is estimated to 950 Tg N/year), is the amount of N used per biomass produced varies most strongly in relation to the share of biomass production in leaves, roots, and wood - and less so in relation to these tissues&amp;rsquo; N content. A great value of this work is also its data output. We now have large compilations of field data with global coverage that will serve our research in many ways. Stay put&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Master thesis - High resolution quantification of seasonal water deficits</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/event_old/hires_cwd/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:46:40 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonal water deficits, caused by the imbalance of water from the land surface through evapotranspiration and runoff and the gain through precipitation, are an important driver of agricultural productivity and forest growth. Recent research by our group (Stocker et al., 2023) has revealed large spatial heterogeneity of seasonal water deficits across the globe at 5 km resolution - interpreted as a reflection of (otherwise unobservable) rooting zone water storage capacity across the soil and bedrock and of plant access to the groundwater, and as a reflection of water use in cropland areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel data resources now provide analysis-ready data at field-scale resolution. This provides an opportunity to extend the analysis of Stocker et al. (2023) to the hillslope-scale. You will develop a workflow to access cloud-hosted Earth Observation data and perform analyses for deriving cumulative water deficits. This will generate crucial insights for a better understanding of the role of terrain in shaping plant water availability and for informing land managers about the sustainability of water resource use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most important: High motivation to work on questions related to land-atmosphere exchange and the carbon cycle - everything else can be learned!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence to work with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with R or other data science tools are an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The student writes the thesis in English.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Bachelor or Master thesis - Trends in seasonal water deficits</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/event_old/cwd_trends/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Droughts have major impacts on fluxes between land and the atmosphere, agricultural production, and the carbon cycle. Future projections of drought magnitude and frequencies are surprisingly divergent and interpretations of trends from Earth System Model outputs have drawn conflicting pictures of drought impact trends in a heating climate. Trends in precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff often point in different directions and are relevant for different aspects of what may be referred to as a “droughts”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will target seasonal water deficits as an impact-relevant quantity measuring the severity of droughts. Using outputs from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), you will derive simulated cumulative water deficit (CWD) time series across the globe for multiple models and investigate their long-term trends.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Master thesis - Droughts in the last millennium</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/event_old/cwd_millennium/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:36:01 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a current scientific debate if the intensity of the recent 2003, 2015, and 2018 droughts is exceptional in the context of the last millennium. Based on tree-ring reconstructions, some authors find them to be within the range of natural variability (Ionita et al. 2021), while others describe them to be unprecedented (Büntgen et al. 2021). Our new climate reconstructions, generated by data-informed climate model simulations enable a testing of these hypotheses (Hand et al., 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this thesis is the analysis of droughts in our new climate reconstruction, which combines various kinds of direct and indirect observations with model simulations since 1420 CE. The drought magnitude will be quantified by considering cumulative water deficits and the long-term statistics of drought event magnitudes will be established. The climate reconstruction (from observations-informed climate model simulations) would allow to study also possible causes like Atlantic sea surface temperature variability or shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are not the last generation that can make a change but the first of many that must. Here are some thoughts I wanted to share with fellow snow enthusiasts and others about what cumulative emissions and tipping points mean for the framing of the need for climate action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog was originially published in German for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protectourwinters.ch/de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Protect Our Winters, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic images of ski slopes in the Alps, desperately groomed with artificial snow and eerily set against a backdrop of green mountains, offer a glimpse of the future. And the future strikes faster than many of us expected. At stake here is what we hold dear. These images are a wake-up call to keep the world the way we love it as outdoor enthusiasts, skiers, snowboarders, climbers, sledders, skaters, snow hikers, and other snow lovers. We are reminded that the climate is changing, that the snow is receding, and that the world as we know it is melting away and is becoming a memory of our past. It&amp;rsquo;s also a wake-up call to protect our winters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protectourwinters.ch/de/handeln/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;POW shows that we can&lt;/a&gt;. Our enthusiasm for nature drives us to preserve it. Climate protection and winter sports belong together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Snow depth in Switzerland as a percentage of the long-term average for the respective day of the year. From &lt;a href=&#34;https://whiterisk.ch/de/snow/comparative-depth&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SLF whiterisk.ch&lt;/a&gt;, 21 February 2023. The map shows that the current snow depth is only between 0 and 60% of the typical depth observed around the 21st of February (average across a 30-year reference period, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slf.ch/de/lawinenbulletin-und-schneesituation/schneekarten/details-zu-schneehoehe-relativ.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that our enthusiasm for the crude wilderness and the cold winter leaves traces. There is no life without traces. That&amp;rsquo;s POW&amp;rsquo;s message: we can and should strive to reduce our impact on the planet and advocate for change, even as we acknowledge that we are not perfect and leave traces. We are imperfect advocates. Yet it is better to be imperfect advocates than to bury our heads in the sand. This message speaks to me as an avid skier, as someone who feels almost patriotic when the alpenglühen of the snow-covered Alps sets in (their fiery appearance of the snow-covered mountains in the setting sun). And it speaks to me as a climate scientist. Because it makes sense - scientifically! Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I were a professional skier (which I dreamed of being at some point in my life, and perhaps even today). I decide to avoid two of my several planned flights this year. This benefits the climate just as much as if you decide not to book your only two planned flights for your next vacation and celebrate an absolutely flight-free year. Although the latter seems purer, more determined, feels more rewarding, and definitely makes for a better-sounding Instagram post, the climate doesn&amp;rsquo;t care. A ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; avoided is a ton avoided - no matter by whom, when, or where on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               src=&#34;https://geco-group.org/media/cumulative_emissions_en_hub748f77588dc525c655fa7fc46898c59_1491831_86cb14d443fb19f3c4fad6a208ecfd7c.webp&#34;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Top: The more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is emitted, the more the mean global temperature rises. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is mainly emitted by fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. The curve is composed of the relationship between the summed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and the temperature increase since 1850. The data are observations for the past (black line and grey band) and from projections with climate models following different future scenarios (SSP1-1.9 is a scenario with rapid reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, SSP5-8.5 is a scenario of strong increase of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions). Graphic adapted from IPCC AR6 WG1 Summary for Policymakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate research shows that each ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we emit causes a certain amount of global warming (see graph above). The warming per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted is roughly constant. Observations and projections from climate models show that the average global temperature is increasing with the sum of all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions since 1850.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that every ton, every gram of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; counts. Every ton contributes equally to climate heating. The climate doesn&amp;rsquo;t care when, where, and anyway by whom the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is emitted. A ton avoided is a ton avoided. This fact contains an important message: it is never too late to avoid a ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Every generation must work to leave the carbon in the ground and save the remaining forests and other carbon-rich ecosystems from their destruction. It is never too late. However, we must continue climate action efforts - starting now and for all generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are not the last generation to save the planet. We are the first of many future generations to make a change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that we are not the last generation to make a difference. On the contrary. We are the first of many generations to make a change. We are the first generation that can seriously turn the wheel in terms of personal life choices and political change that we can set in motion by voting, electing politicians, and by protesting. Here in Switzerland, where I live, we are the first generation to vote on important climate legislation, and we have a second chance this year with the upcoming vote on the counter-proposal to the Glacier Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be fatal to abandon efforts even if the world has warmed by 1.5 degrees Celsius - the number the global community has set as a target. There is no magic threshold at this temperature rise. There are tipping points in the climate system, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when they will be reached. That&amp;rsquo;s a big &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;research question&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s still open. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter for our decision to protect our winters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a white-out - the situation when you completely lose your bearings in the fog and snow. To go further would be to enter unknown and potentially dangerous terrain and to continue to approach a possible precipice. In this situation, we know it is safer to turn around and retrace our steps. By burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, we have already entered unknown terrain. The climate today is not the same as it was fifty years ago. However, the further we move into this unknown terrain, the more damage we have to expect to our ecosystems, our food production, and our infrastructure. With each additional ton of carbon burned, we march further toward uncertainty. The risk of unexpected climate events and crossing a dangerous climate tipping point increases the further we advance into the unknown terrain. More climate change will make our lives more difficult. For this reason, we must do everything we can to stay in the safe zone.
We have already warmed the planet. Some loss of glaciers and snow is already underway. Even with stringent climate action, we will lose more glaciers in the coming decades. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This recent study&lt;/a&gt; backs up this prediction with disturbing numbers. Glaciers behave like a large cargo ship. Even if the engine stops, the ship will keep going for a while. Even if we drastically reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, many glaciers will disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to warming the planet, it&amp;rsquo;s a different story. As soon as the emission of greenhouse gases is stopped, we stop heating the Earth (as explained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;). It is in our own hands. This is very encouraging. It means we can turn the wheel to avoid even more dangerous levels of climate change and trespassing dangerous tipping points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must avoid emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases to prevent further warming of the planet. Every ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; counts, whether it&amp;rsquo;s today or tomorrow. No matter what you did yesterday, you can start fresh the next day. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect to take action on climate change and be part of the change we need to &lt;strong&gt;protect our winters&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protectourwinters.ch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Protect Our Winters&lt;/a&gt; is a non-governmental organization that advocates for climate action and political change. POW speaks to snow enthusiasts and other concerned, but winter fun-loving people through their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protectourwinters.ch/de/netzwerk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alliance Members&lt;/a&gt; - professional skiers, snowboarders and others. As a ski touring aficionado and climate scientist, I am proud to be part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protectourwinters.ch/de/netzwerk/science-alliance/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;POW Science Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. I am convinced that speaking to a wide diversity of voters and fellow Earthlings through shared values and a common understanding of what we want to protect (winters!) is a powerful approach to motivating climate action.&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>Optimal root zone water storage capacity</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/rooting-zone/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 07:56:38 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/rooting-zone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Root zone water storage capacity (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is related to the rooting depth and the water holding capacity across the soil profile. It is an important property in determining ecosystem photosynthesis and evapotranspiration in rain-free periods and controls the sensitivity of ecosystems and their carbon and water fluxes to drought conditions. While S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an essential parameter of land surface models, it is almost impossible to measure in the field, at least not across large scales. Considering that S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is also highly variable across small spatial scales, and that it varies massively between species and between different biomes, it is really a sort of elephant in the room for large-scale drought impacts modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have estimated the root zone water storage capacity based on a water mass balance approach where the parallel time series of evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;) are considered (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2014GL061668&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gao et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). This approach was also the starting point of our analysis, which has been published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01125-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;(Stocker et al., 2023)&lt;/a&gt;. Using remote sensing and climate reanalysis data, provided at ~5 km resolution, we derived continuous daily time series of the cumulative water deficit (CWD) over the years 2003-2017 for each pixel across the globe. Knowing how much water is lost from the land surface during dry periods is the key for estimating how much locally stored water plants have access to. With this rationale, we calculated a first estimate for the global distribution of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; , informed by extreme values of annual CWD maxima in each pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that a key ingredient to such diagnosed S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimates is the ET data. The challenging aspect is that most remote sensing-based ET products make an assumption about S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - either directly or indirectly - for determining the sensitivity of ET to a drying of the soil. Of course, when using such ET products, the diagnosed S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; just reflects assumptions embodied in the algorithm used for estimating ET. There is a clear risk for circularity. This made us search for ET estimates that are free of such an assumption. As an additional help in guiding our search for a suitable ET estimate was its performance when evaluated against local measurements. Our search identified a clear winner: ALEXI-ET (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074952&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hain &amp;amp; Anderson, 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of relying on an a priori specified water stress function, it makes use of information gleaned from surface temperature remote sensing and parallel climate reanalysis. The ALEXI algorithm thus infers ET from the surface and atmospheric energy budget. Furthermore, our evaluation of different remote sensing-based ET products revealed that ALEXI-ET yields ET estimates that exhibit no systematic bias with the level of water stress - in contrast to the alternatives we tested. This gave us confidence to move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question we addressed was whether the CWD maxima reflect root zone dimensions or (just) the hydroclimate. Interpreting apparent CWD maxima as a reflection of the rooting depth implicitly assumes that the actual rooting zone water storage capacity is just large enough and roots just deep enough to yield the apparent water deficits in the dry season. Given the opportunity costs of building deep roots, such a sizing would be optimal from an eco-evolutionary perspective. To test whether this is the case, we looked at the vegetation activity and analyzed how it responds to water deficits. As a measure for vegetation activity, we focus on sun-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized by incident solar radiation, and on the evaporative fraction, defined as ET divided by net radiation. Regressing vegetation activity against CWD yields information about the sensitivity of vegetation to water stress from which we estimated the CWD at which vegetation activity ceases. If this “cessation CWD” agrees with the magnitude of CWD extremes, we have a further indication that roots are indeed just deep enough to get the water needed to sustain rare drought events. And indeed, we found close correspondence between the two quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further test of our remote sensing-based S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimates, we made use of a recently published comprehensive compilation of field data of rooting depths from over 5000 individual field observations across the globe and covering all major biomes (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.18031&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tumber-Davila et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). Also at this scale, we found consistent patterns. The deepest roots are found where seasonal water deficits are largest and the shallowest roots are found in climates where annual CWD maxima are small. Interestingly, the largest root zone water storage capacities and rooting depths are diagnosed from space and observed in the field not in the driest climates, but in monsoonal climates and biomes with perennial plants and where (more or less) green vegetation cover is maintained throughout the year. In contrast, vegetation pursues an “ephemeral” strategy in the driest climates - relieving the necessity of rooting excessively deep for maintaining activity. This is probably also an expression of an optimal balancing of trade-offs - investing in deep roots is only a viable option if it is not outweighed by the costs of rebuilding leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparent cumulative water deficits, the sensitivity of vegetation activity to dry conditions, and the rooting depth of plants converge to consistent patterns. The implications of these insights are manifold. First, we now have information about the global distribution of the apparent rooting zone water storage capacity which can be used to better parametrise land surface models. This may be useful for removing persistent bias in ET simulations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027194&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ma et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;). Second, our maps document large variations of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; across multiple scales - across the Earth’s biomes, across land uses (irrigated croplands emerge as hotspots of water losses), and across topography (larger water losses along rivers and deltas than in flat upland areas). This insight is enabled by the high spatial resolution of our global-scale analysis. Third, and maybe most strikingly, our estimates of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; suggest that plants source more water than can be stored in two meters of soil across a third of the Earth’s surface. We don’t know the soil depth across the globe very well. Models have to rely on assumptions and commonly use prescribed rooting depths. The picture drawn from our S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimates and from other emerging research (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800141115&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Rempe et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03761-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;McCormick et al., 2021&lt;/a&gt;) is that plant-accessible water stores are surprisingly large in many places and that water stored in the weathered bedrock and groundwater probably play a more important role in regulating land-atmosphere exchange of water vapor and photosynthesis than is currently appreciated and considered in land surface and Earth system models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forests currently represent a large carbon sink, offsetting a quarter of human CO2 emissions each year, bur large uncertainty remains on the future strength of this sink. Namely, vegetation models assume that tree growth is essentially limited by photosynthesis, but recent evidence suggests that currently unaccounted for biophysical limitations to tree growth by low temperatures and water stress can substantially decouple tree growth from photosynthesis. The degree to which biophysical limitations might slow down forest carbon storage is still unclear but has potentially critical implications for climate projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to implement biophysical limitations to tree growth in an established mechanistic vegetation model in order to quantify the effect of these new controls on forest primary production. This will require (1) designing the integration of fine scale biophysical equations with carbon-based tree growth schemes of the vegetation model, (2) evaluating model performance against annual and decadal observations of historical tree growth and forest production across Europe and (3) simulate forest production using current and new tree growth schemes to evaluate the impact of biophysical limitations on forest production under different climate scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis is a great starting point for mechanistic ecosystem modelling and working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere. Basic knowledge of programming are a requirement and prior experience with R and/or Fortran are an advantage. You may start as soon as you like.

      <title>LSD Heatscatter with ggplot</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 23:19:08 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/lsd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/LSD/versions/4.0-0/topics/heatscatter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;heatscatter()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LSD/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LSD R package&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve even used it for my own publications (see Figs. 2 and 7 in &lt;a href=&#34;https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15123&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stocker et al. 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Since having written this paper and creating the figures I&amp;rsquo;ve (finally) moved to using ggplot. Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;heatscatter()&lt;/code&gt; creates a plot in base R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling, I found no satisfying solution. What is described on &lt;a href=&#34;http://auguga.blogspot.com/2015/10/r-heat-scatter-plot.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; does&amp;rsquo;t really do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried another approach. I forked the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stineb/LSD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LSD library into my github&lt;/a&gt; and hacked an additional argument into the &lt;code&gt;heatscatter()&lt;/code&gt; function as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt; a logical: if &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; uses the ggplot2 library to create plots. Defaults to &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When set to &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, the function returns a ggplot object. For example the following bit of code &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;gg &amp;lt;- heatscatter(mdf$lue_mod, mdf$lue_obs, xlab = &amp;#34;Modelled&amp;#34;, ylab = &amp;#34;Observed&amp;#34;, ggplot = TRUE)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;gg + lab(title = &amp;#34;Example&amp;#34;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; prints a simple plot, by default (and hard-coded), using ggplot&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;theme_classic()&lt;/code&gt;. This looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://geco-group.org/img/ggplot_heatscatter_example.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. A direct link to the hacked &lt;code&gt;heatscatter()&lt;/code&gt; function is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stineb/LSD/blob/master/R/LSD.heatscatter.R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying drought impacts in a data-rich world</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/soilm_global/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 11:56:10 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/soilm_global/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a data-rich world. Satellites are collecting information about the state of the Earth surface in ever more fine-grained resolution. CO2 and water exchange fluxes between the vegetation and the atmosphere are continuously measured at several hundred sites across the globe. And (almost) all of this data is being made easily accessible to researchers from any institution or country. This data revolution has created a playground for data analysis and a testbed for models with an unprecedented potential for addressing scientific challenges and resolving pressing questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do droughts affect photosynthesis, vegetation productivity and the global carbon cycle?&lt;/em&gt; is one such question. Remote-sensing based models are widely used for estimating terrestrial photosynthesis. These commonly use information about the greenness of the Earth surface, incoming solar radiation and some measure of dryness. Due to the limitation that soil moisture is particularly challenging to observe from satellites, these models have commonly resorted to using information only on the atmospheric dryness (vapour pressure deficit). In view of known physiological mechanisms by which plants respond to drying soils, the question is: Does vapour pressure deficit alone provide enough information to simulate drought impacts on vegetation? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of our world’s data richness is that we now have more precise insights from observations to better uncover weaknesses in models. One such insight we gained in an earlier study (Stocker et al., 2018), where we isolated the soil moisture effect on photosynthesis from other drivers, including the (partly co-varying) vapour pressure deficit. By analysing patterns in the data from flux measurements and satellites, we found a clear additional effect by soil moisture that substantially reduces photosynthesis during “soil moisture droughts” - an effect that cannot be estimated when solely relying on information on vapour pressure deficit. It was an obvious question to ask whether the remote sensing-based terrestrial photosynthesis models, which do not account for soil moisture directly, can still accurately simulate photosynthesis during these, now well-defined drought periods. Freely accessible data and an open data sharing philosophy of the research community made it possible that within a short amount of time, we had all the necessary resources to start investigating. And soon thereafter, we had our Eureka moment: Indeed, all the models we investigated had a very clear relationship with the timing and magnitude of the apparent soil moisture stress we identified earlier. This is what we show in the paper, now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt; (Stocker et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding has implications not only for simulating vegetation productivity, but also for estimating the impacts of extreme events and the year-to-year variations of the terrestrial carbon balance. Dry and hot periods like last year’s summer in northern Europe can negatively affect the C balance of a whole continent and thereby accelerate the man-made increase in atmospheric CO2. Our new paper shows that the size of such anomalies, and therefore the magnitude of disruption of the C cycle, is substantially underestimated when the additional effect by soil moisture stress is neglected. This clearly points to the need for revising satellite-based monitoring of vegetation productivity and to develop new methods for including information on how soil moisture varies across space and time and how this affects vegetation productivity. Our findings come at a time when several groups are developing new methods to use remotely sensed information to estimate soil moisture. Resolving this challenge is important as with a changing climate, periods of drought may become more frequent, intense and prolonged and we need to have a better grasp of how this affects ecosystems and the carbon cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contrasting CO2 emissions from different Holocene land-use reconstructions: Does the carbon budget add up?</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/hololu/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:02:29 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/hololu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reliable reconstructions of past land-use change are essential to address several key challenges in understanding the role of humans in the Earth’s environmental history. Here we discuss how to integrate our understanding of past carbon cycle changes within constraints of the land carbon budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This article was published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://boris.unibe.ch/119602/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PAGES Magazine Special Issue on Past Land Use and Land Cover Change&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particular features in the ice-core CO2 and CH4 records have been hypothesized to be linked to the rise and fall of agriculture and societies (Ruddiman 2003) and have been used to serve as stratigraphic markers for the Anthropocene (Lewis and Maslin 2015). The trend reversals in atmospheric CO2 around 7000 yr BP and in CH4 around 5000 yr BP and their continuous increase thereafter have been linked to the expansion of early agriculture, associated deforestation and CO2 emissions, and the establishment of wet rice cultivation with high CH4 emissions. The apparent downturn in atmospheric CO2 after 1500 CE falls into the period following the arrival of Europeans in the Americas and the subsequent dramatic collapse of native populations. However, these proposed hypotheses, claiming a causal link between the history of civilizations and greenhouse gas changes, critically rest on the plausibility of land-use and land-cover change (LULC) reconstructions and the magnitude of associated greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrasting land use reconstructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LULC has reduced the land area covered by forest throughout much of the Holocene. Today, about a third of the Earth’s surface area is — more or less intensively — in use for agriculture. This estimate of modern land use is derived from national statistics and satellite data. However, such precise information is only available for the last few decades. Proxy records of past vegetation cover from pollen recorded in lake sediments or bogs have only just begun to be used for quantitative land cover reconstructions (Editorial, this issue). Instead, reconstructions of past LULC are typically based on estimates of historical population size and assumptions on the per-capita requirement of cropland and pasture area over the Holocene. These values are highly uncertain, and the most widely used land-use reconstructions provide conflicting results (see Harrison et al., this issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacement of forests by agricultural land also affects the energy balance at the land surface, reduces evapotranspiration where trees have been replaced by crops and grasses, and increases evapotranspiration where lands are being irrigated. It further increases the surface albedo, especially in northern latitudes when snow is present. This effect has contributed to a cooling in the mid-latitudes that counteracted LULC-induced warming due to greenhouse-gas emissions, and may have exacerbated cold conditions during the Little Ice Age (Betts et al. 2007). Reducing the large uncertainties in reconstructions of past LULC is therefore important to define a reliable land surface forcing as a boundary condition for climate model simulations covering past centuries and millennia and for other earth system simulations that use preindustrial (commonly taken as year 1850) boundary conditions (see also Harrison et al., this issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land conversion also impacts carbon (C) storage in the soil. The long residence time of soil carbon entails legacy effects of past land use on the land carbon balance, even decades after land conversion. Conflicting land-use reconstructions underpin the ongoing debate about the extent and impact of preindustrial human activities on the carbon cycle and climate. However, there are two constraints that help narrow the range of possible land-use histories in the past (Stocker et al. 2017) and the influence of past LULC on climate and the carbon cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints on LULC histories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the present-day state of land use and the biomass density of vegetation across space is relatively well-known. The difference between C storage in actual vegetation and in potential natural vegetation is equal to cumulative CO2 emissions from past LULC since the first agriculturalists. Hence, cumulative LULC CO2 emissions are relatively well-constrained, which implies that uncertainty in past LULC emissions becomes mainly a problem of distributing their cumulative total through time. More emissions in distant millennia imply that less is left for the more recent past. Emissions have to converge to within the constrained range of estimates for cumulative emissions. Quantitatively, Stocker et al. (2017) found relatively small differences in cumulative LULC-induced CO2 emissions when applying different LULC histories in their model (Figure 1). However, further research is needed to reduce remaining uncertainty in cumulative emissions and differences between satellite and model-based estimates (Erb et al. 2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second constraint comes from the total C budget of the terrestrial biosphere. Ice-core data on past CO2 concentrations and carbon-isotopic composition have been successfully used to reconstruct the net C balance of the land biosphere, as well as the C balance of the ocean (Elsig et al. 2009). Knowing all natural contributions to land C inventory changes, we can isolate anthropogenic sources by difference. Despite imperfect knowledge on C sources and sinks from all ecosystems, this approach provides a way to integrate our understanding of past C cycle changes within the budget constraint. Two examples below illustrate this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprecedented terrestrial C release after 1850 CE: very likely anthropogenic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period 1850-1920 CE, ice-core data suggest a substantial terrestrial C source of 45 PgC in total. This is on average 0.64 PgC/yr, or around half the current annual CO2 emissions from modern LULC and by far the most rapid land C balance change ever recorded in all preceding periods of the Holocene. Is this the anthropogenic signal? One reconstruction of past LULC (HYDE 3.2) suggests emissions that fall right into the same magnitude as this apparent land C source (Figure 1). The alternative reconstruction (KK10) suggests a much larger land area under use in 1850 CE than HYDE 3.2. This necessarily leaves less room for further land-use expansion after that and resulting emissions cannot explain the net C source derived from the ice-core data. Additional natural C loss from land in response to the slight warming trend was likely counteracted by the fertilising effect of slowly rising CO2 between 1850 and 1920 CE, assuming that our estimates of these feedback strengths are accurate. Taken together, the land C budget suggests that the KK10 scenario, featuring extensive deforestation before 1850 CE, leaves a C source of 31 PgC unexplained and therefore appears less likely than a more moderate extent of pre-1850 CE deforestation as suggested by HYDE 3.2. However, KK10 is more in line with pollen-based quantitative vegetation reconstructions in northwestern Europe (Kaplan et al. 2017) than HYDE 3.2. Nonetheless, these considerations of the land C budget and timing of emissions illustrate the relevance of improving preindustrial land-use reconstructions to understand terrestrial C sources and sinks and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks also in the most recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 1 (a) Time series of global total land area under agricultural land use for HYDE and KK10 (total of pasture and croplands in HYDE 3.2). The time axis is broken at 1700 CE, showing a different scale before (ka = 1000 cal yr BP) and after. Total expansion for the two scenarios between 1850 and 1920 CE is illustrated by arrows on the right. (b) The terrestrial C budget for the period 1850 to 1920 CE. Cumulative CO2 emissions from LULC for HYDE 3.2 (magenta) match within uncertainties the total terrestrial C stock change inferred from the atmospheric CO2 record (green), whereas LULC emissions for KK10 (cyan) are much smaller. C uptake by peat (blue) is small. LULC emissions are from simulations with the LPX-Bern vegetation model (Stocker et al. 2017).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice-core CO2 and its isotopic composition suggest no significant change in terrestrial C storage between 5 and 3 ka BP. Could large anthropogenic emissions have been masked by an equally large and contemporaneous natural C sink? Indeed, the build-up of northern peatlands, initiated after ice-age conditions, was a major C sink at these time scales. Through large-scale data synthesis (Loisel et al. 2014) and global modelling (Stocker et al., 2014), it is now possible to estimate the C sequestration in peatlands throughout the Holocene. This allows us to subtract their contribution from the total land C balance and reveals a large terrestrial non-peatland C source that must have contributed to the near-neutral land C balance (Figure 2). Can anthropogenic emissions close the budget? Probably not. A comparison of the inferred natural non-peatland C source with LULC emission estimates based on available LULC reconstructions suggests that other still unknown natural sources must have contributed to C cycle changes during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 2 Terrestrial C budget in the period 5-3 ka BP. The total terrestrial net change (green) is derived from from ice core CO2 and δ13C data. The difference between the total net change and peat uptake (blue) provides a top-down constraint on the sum of CO2 emissions from LULC and other natural sources (grey bars). LULC emissions are estimated based on two alternative scenarios, HYDE 3.2 (magenta) and KK10 (turquoise).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other gradual changes in the land C cycle amount to substantial sinks or sources at these long time scales. Examples include permafrost changes, the continuous build-up of soil C after the retreat of ice sheets, biome shifts in response to monsoon weakening in Africa and summer cooling in the boreal zone after the Mid-Holocene. It would be fruitful to specifically target and reduce uncertainties in these less well quantified but important components of the land C cycle through multi-model studies, constrained by data from paleoecological archives. This would allow us to isolate additional components of the terrestrial C budget and further narrow the range of possible land-use histories. This range will additionally be reduced by integrating information from pollen-based vegetation reconstructions and archaeology-based land use characteristics as produced by the PAGES LandCover6k Working Group (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pages-igbp.org/ini/wg/landcover6k/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.pages-igbp.org/ini/wg/landcover6k/&lt;/a&gt;, see also Editorial and Harrison et al., this issue). The combination of such bottom-up and top-down constraints for the land C budget will improve our understanding of the Earth’s environmental history and the role of humans therein.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why we need ecosystem manipulation experiments to reveal the coupled C-N system’s behaviour</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/cn_experiments/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 13:17:30 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I’m going to argue why it is crucial to use observational data from ecosystem manipulation experiments (EME) for model evaluation and calibration. And I’m going to make this case using the example of nitrogen limitation and how EMEs guided the development of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) over the last one-and-a-half decades and repeatedly exposed their deficiencies. This, I hope, will convince you that there is a great future in a close relationship between modellers and experimentalists around the data from EMEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a brief clarification about the relationship between models, in particular DGVMs, and data. DGVMs are process-based representations of ecosystem functioning and provide a bottom-up description of vegetation and biogeochemical cycles by explicitly simulating stand-level processes such as photosynthesis, growth, carbon allocation, mortality, fire, etc. This type of model contrasts statistical models, for example species distribution models, where statistical relationships, determined from data, are used to relate environmental variables to the model’s state variables of interest. In DGVMs, explicit processes are described by equations and parameters that can be directly measured. The simulated interplay of these processes finally governs higher-levels variables, such as NPP (see Fig. 1). Therefore, just to clarify, DGVMs don’t directly “use” data. Instead, data can be used indirectly to constrain or calibrate the parameters in DGVMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://geco-group.org/img/modeltypes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The relationship of models and data in DGVMs and statistical models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, why is the data from manipulation experiments so particularly interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at a range of observational benchmarking datasets, one may conclude that DGVMs are a good representation of the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere. They do a fairly good job at capturing the current state and reliably simulate the global distributions of biomes, biomass, soil C stocks, and GPP. One may also look at the seasonality of C uptake and release fluxes: (One of the success stories of DGVMs is that they simulate the “breathing of the biosphere”) and even at the mean of the net terrestrial C balance and conclude that these models up to the job (Le Quere et al., 2016). And they have been up to that job since more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://geco-group.org/img/cbalance_trendy.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 2 Terrestrial C balance from the global carbon budget (black) and a set of DGVMs (figure from Le Quere et al., 2016).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, about a decade ago, the first generation of DGVMs predicted that the land biosphere will act as a large and persistent C sink under continuously rising CO2 (Cramer et al., 2001; Friedlingstein et al., 2006). This prediction made it into the IPCC AR4 (Prentice et al., 2007) and these types of vegetation models were adopted as components in coupled Earth System Models that are used for climate projections still today. But at around the same time appeared the first results from long-term ecosystem manipulation experiments. Their results suggested that this sustained land C sink is no longer supported by insights from Free-Air-CO2-Enrichment (FACE) experiments and multiple studies found that N is the dominant factor limiting plant growth (Schneider et al., 2004; Norby et al., 2010; Reich &amp;amp; Hobbie, 2012). None of the DGVMs yet accounted for such limiting effects. Therefore, speculations were made about the mechanisms that would lead to such an outcome that develops over several years. The Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) hypothesis was proposed (Luo et al., 2004) which suggests that upon a (e.g. CO2-induced) stimulation of growth, N gets locked up in live biomass and depleted in the soil. This would lead to an increase in the tissue C:N ratio which, when added to litter, would further reduce soil net N mineralisation and N availability. The initial growth stimulation would progressively disappear. However, observational evidence for the PNL was not clear and an alternative hypothesis, stating that increased belowground C inputs would stimulate N mineralisation, could not be excluded either (Reich &amp;amp; Hobbie, 2012). A key point I want to make here is that evidence for such mechanisms coming from the a few experiments is to some degree anecdotal and we’re sometimes faced with counterintuitive results that fit none of the popular hypotheses (see e.g. Feng et al., 2015). Our understanding of the systems’ functioning has to be coded up in the form of a quantitative, process-based model. Only this gives us predictive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what stuck regarding N limitation was the Perspectives paper by Hungate et al. (2013) in Science where they argued that the C sequestration simulated by C-only DGVMs implies that an amount of N would become available that was far beyond their estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set the target for the modelling community: “We need a N cycle”. And what should it do? Limit something. For example GPP (see CLM model) or NPP (see most other models). Liebig’s Law of the Minimum sounds like a reasonable approach and in Fortran there is even a function: MIN( potential_X, limited_X ). And if the assimilated C cannot be matched by N taken up from the soil, excess C is respired back to the atmosphere. Finally, we probably want to increase tissue C:N ratios when N is limiting so we would get something like the PNL with the model (although there is no observational evidence for it). A few years later, the first modelling groups proclaimed: “We now have a nitrogen cycle in our model”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these models had to pass the usual tests against observational data: C stocks and fluxes. And now, that loads of data has become available, systematic benchmarking and model parameter calibration using Bayesian statistics was by now high on the agenda of modellers. With a few necessary tweaks, the models still performed well when faced with the benchmarks and after all, the models were now a good deal more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something fundamental changed. By the time IPCC AR5 was published only two ESMs with a land component simulating the interactions between C and N cycles were included. These showed a strongly muted response to both CO2 and climate (Fig. 3). Over the years, as more models came along, the muted response to CO2 and climate was corroborated (Achat et al., 2016). A strong N limitation is simulated by these types of models. This, in general, satisfied Hungate’s objection. That gave the community enough confidence to take on the next step as the next big resource limitation was looming: phosphorous. The predictions of these latest types of DGVMs that account for both N and P limitation is hardly surprising: An even stronger reduction of the simulated land C uptake under scenarios of rising CO2 (Wieder et al., 2015, Achat et al., 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem with these models. And this problem was revealed by an in-depth model evaluation against two ecosystem manipulation experiments (Zaehle et al., 2014; De Kauwe et al., 2014). A suite of models with interactive C and N cycles were evaluated against observational data from the Duke and ORNL FACE experiments. The importance of what this evaluation revealed cannot be overstated. In brief, it showed that all models get the right response (NPP stimulation under elevated CO2) for the wrong reasons (increasing tissue C:N instead of increasing N uptake, Fig. 4). And it did so by evaluating the sensitivities of mechanisms and their interactions in response to a large perturbation. The system is hit hard enough to reveal the relevant mechanism that finally determine the strength and persistence of the CO2 fertilisation effect. The important lesson from this is that none of the other typical benchmarking datasets would not enable such insights. Sensitivities are only becoming apparent if the system is pushed to a completely different state. Only by looking at data from ecosystem manipulation experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://geco-group.org/img/zaehlefig.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a problem and where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential insight from the analysis by Zaehle et al. (2014) is that the increase in N uptake under elevated CO2 was massively underestimated. In other words, there must be mechanisms by which plants can acquire additional N if needed and that these mechanisms are missing in models. How does this relate to the indusputable effect of N limitation? How can ecosystems be limited by N, yet get addtional N under elevated CO2? What are the limits to this? How flexible are these bounds of N and P availability that underlie the argument by Hungate and Penuelas? And can we model this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is there to resolve this apparent contradiction. It may all make sense in the view of a evolution and the tendency for optimal functioning. In that sense, optimal growth tends to achieve a functional balance (Davidson, 1969). The underlying hypothesis is that plants optimise their growth strategy and C allocation in the face of multiple limiting resources. They thereby achieve a functional balance between aboveground and belowground growth and stimulation of the rhizosphere. Hence, plants may get additional N but it comes at the cost of root growth and exudation of labile C into the rhizosphere. This may seem all too reasonable, if not obvious to you but it’s important to note that currently available DGVMs do not embody this theory. They do not simulate the essential trade-offs and sufficient flexibility in allocation. But such an approach is arguably a much cleverer way to simulate plants than to assume that excess assimilated C that is not matched by N uptake is pointlessly respired into the air. And simplified models, typically applied at the point-scale are available and have shown that this approach works. But what about observational evidence for such trade-offs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, ecosystem manipulation experiments hold the answer. Here are some new results. To investigate the data, we adopted what one may call a “modelling perspective” and investigated just this trade-off. Cesar Terrer led this research where we posed the question “At what cost does the additional N uptake come?” Comparing data from plots under ambient and elevated CO2, we quantified the ratio of the relative increase in N uptake divided by the relative increase in belowground biomass or productivity. Here are the results that are soon going to be published in New Phytologist (Fig. 5):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

(b) Mean, standard error, max and min return on investment (ΨN-1, Eq. 1). Figure from Terrer et al. (accepted).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be too nice to evaluate a range of C-N models against such data. Unfortunately, such detailed model-data analyses as done by the FACE-MDS project are extremely laborious. But we can identify a robust observation, for example a shift towards more belowground C allocation as CO2 increases and have a quick look at the TRENDY models to see whether they simulate such a response (Fig. 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. They’re not. But that’s hardly surprising since these models typically rely on formulations of allocation that are relatively rigid and do not properly simulate growth plasticity in response to shifts in resource availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own research, I’ve been working towards building a new type of DGVM that addresses this shortcoming. Inspired by the simpler models that simulate optimal allocation, I’ve put the necessary components together to simulate the coupled cycling of C and N in a grassland ecosystem, based on a functional balance approach. I’ve applied this model, forced by meteorological data and info on management (cutting, N fertilisation) from SwissFACE experiment. The comparison to observational data looks promising (Fig. 7):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 7 Response in harvested aboveground biomass (left), root carbon (middle), and the fraction of N derived from biological N fixation (left). Simulated (black lines) and observed (boxes). Treatments are 0: control, C: elevated CO2, N: N fertilisation, CN: elevated CO2 and N fertilisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model reproduces the strong N limitation of aboveground productivity and – what’s not known from the field measurements, but consistent with data from separate pot measurements – simulates a shift to more belowground C allocation. It also successfully simulates the controls on N fixation rates and captures its responses to elevated CO2 and N fertiliser additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we believe that with such a model we have robust predictive capabilities, we can start looking into the long-term response of the coupled system. And there are some interesting features regarding N limitation. The same model that reproduces the strong N limitation of the aboveground growth stimulation under elevated CO2 simulates a trajectory of progressive release from N limitation (Fig. 8). This indicates that N limitation is not a strict cap, but affects vegetation functioning so that growth comes at an additional cost, but there is flexibility in accessing additional N if required. This is even without any N fixation in the system. However, these mechanisms play out only in the long run. Here, according to the model, at time scales of decades. Ecosystem manipulation experiments cannot usually be maintained that long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the conclusion of this? We need manipulation experiments. They are absolutely essential for understanding how the system responds to global environmental change and to evaluate models. But here, I might be preaching to the choir (This here is presented to a conference of ecosystem manipulators). I hope I also convinced you that we need models along with the data, and even more importantly: a strong interaction between modelers and experimentalists. From observations alone we cannot directly make predictions for a highly coupled system. Anecdotal systems understanding (e.g. PNL, …) is too often faced with seemingly counterintuitive systems behaviour. Neither should modellers treat confrontation of model results with data as a “end-of-the-pipe” exercise that can only lead to the conclusion that “the model does a reasonable job” (when looking at it from a save distance) [citing Colin Prentice]. Instead, we should embrace a model-data-circle, as advocated by the FACE-MDS team and published by Medlyn et al. (2015). Assumption-centered model evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fertility Question: How do soil nutrients influence the carbon cycle?</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/fertilityquestion/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2015 13:31:09 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/fertilityquestion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A general notion of “soil fertility” is commonly left unaccounted for in models of the terrestrial biosphere and has received relatively little attention in carbon cycle science. This changed since the presentation of results by Vicca et al. (2012) and Fernandez-Martinez et al. (2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from forests around the globe where gross primary productivity (GPP) has been measured in parallel to changes in ecosystem biomass storage, these authors showed that forests produce biomass more efficiently on fertile soils.
This efficiency can be quantified as the ratio of biomass production (BP) to GPP. Two factors affect this ratio. First, autotrophic respiration (Ra) – the C cost of maintaining cellular function (maintenance respiration) and synthesising new tissue (growth respiration). This factor has been shown previously to cause relatively large variations in CUE (= NPP/GPP = (GPP-Ra)/GPP) due to effects of forest stand age, climate, and forest type. However, Ra doesn’t appear to vary with soil fertility (Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2014). The second factor that determines the ratio of BP:GPP is the amount of C exported to the soil (Cex). There is also a third factor, the production of volatile organic compounds, VOCs, that has been shown to significantly affect the plant’s C budget, especially under heat stress. Let’s ignore this for now. Traditionally, Cex hasn’t commonly been separated out from NPP, and is often left unquantified in field studies. However, more recent research has shown that up to around 20% of NPP may be consumed by Cex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;:    BP = GPP – Ra – Cex – VOC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;:    NPP = GPP – Ra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the observed variations on BP:GPP by Vicca et al. (2012) and Fernandez-Martinez et al. (2014), they also found that the ratio of fine root to total biomass was almost three times higher in nutrient poor than in nutrient rich forest, and that the LAI per unit fine-root biomass is twice as large in nutrient rich forests. This is perfectly in line with earlier studies reporting general and strong variations of these allocation patterns along soil fertility gradients (Poorter et al., 2012). Apparently, on low-fertility soils, plants invest more C below-ground. C allocation thus dynamically adjusts in response to soil fertility – a mechanism ignored by today’s generation of global vegetation and terrestrial carbon cycle models altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where does Cex go and what is its function? Clearly, growing more roots serves a better soil exploration in the search for nutrients required for plant growth (apart from accessing soil moisture and maybe even ground water). In contrast, the exuded C (Cex) may be consumed by an array of soil organisms with the pleasant effect of improving nutrient availability for the plant – either directly (N2-fixing bacteria in root nodules; mycorrhizal fungi living on the root tips) or indirectly (free-living N2-fixing bacteria in the soil; other heterotrophs that accelerate soil turnover and N mineralization, so called priming). The importance of these effects are only now becoming to be fully appreciated and integrated into models of the terrestrial C budget, and a quantitative and mechanistic link to soil fertility is yet to be established – the goal of my work here in the group of Colin Prentice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson from all this (relatively new) research described above is that the nutrient availability appears to be under clear biological control, but that their acquisition comes at a cost to the plant: C used below-ground (root production and Cex) is missing for above-ground growth and the competition for light. We can say that this cost is dependent on the soil fertility and implies that there must be a soil fertility-dependent balance of above- versus below-ground allocation that is optimal for the plant with respect to maximizing its “fitness”. Such considerations are the target of theoretical studies that bear great potential in providing quantitative predictions of C allocation (Mäkelä et al., 2008; Franklin et al., 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now two more points that need clarification: 1. What is soil fertility? and 2. How does the concept of soil fertility relate to the classical view of nutrient limitation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soil fertility is often indirectly defined by “where plants grow well”. This may also be expressed as “where nutrients are easily available” a condition affected by the soil chemistry and structure in ways that are difficult to describe and predict mechanistically, especially at a global scale. However, there is a set of parameters often measured, directly or indirectly, in the field that appear to determine “soil fertility”. These include pH, the cation exchange capacity, available N and P, C:N ratio of soil organic matter, C content, and the texture (fractions of sand, clay, loam, silt). The soil type itself is something like a “syndrome” expressed by typical values of these measurable parameters, but may also provide readily accessible information. Soil formation is determined by climate, parent material, and time. This is reflected by large scale gradients of soil fertility across different biomes – from infertile, acidic soils in boreal regions; fertile, C rich soils in seasonally cold grasslands where decomposition is inhibited; N-poor but otherwise relatively fertile young soils in temperate region; to highly weathered, i.e. P-poor, old soils in tropical lowlands. Sorption of P to surfaces in the particular soil matrix in tropical soils, leaching of mobile P under high precipitation, and very small inputs through atmospheric deposition gradually deplete soils of P over time in the tropics, while N is gradually added by abundant N fixing organisms. As opposed to such old tropical lowland soils, soils at high latitudes are younger (previous glaciation!) and P is still more readily available, whereas constraints to N fixation prevent its accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure HWSD Global Soil Quality – constraints on nutrient availability (Fisher et al., 2008). Accessed from &lt;a href=&#34;http://databasin.org/datasets/20dcb500682c4ec891e2fc881c2ed65c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://databasin.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant pattern of N limitation in boreal and temperate biomes and P limitation in tropical biomes is also revealed by classical fertilization experiments. Added N generally stimulates plant growth at higher latitudes (but not so for added P), and vice versa at low latitudes. Such a nutrient limitation concept is implemented in different ESMs: Either GPP or NPP is capped and further plant growth is halted if nutrients (usually just N, sometimes also P) becomes unavailable. This leads to substantially lower predictions of C uptake under rising CO2 and the important negative feedback to anthropogenic climate change (through CO2 emissions) disappears almost completely when applying such models (Wieder et al., 2015). But doesn’t this disagree with the widely observed, and theoretically plausible biological control on nutrient availability as discussed above? I would argue that yes indeed, these predictions are add odds with them! This Liebig Law-type view of nutrient limitation also fails to explain the clear CO2 stimulation of growth under high-N as well as low-N conditions. So how can the observed variations of BP:GPP with soil fertility and nutrient limitation be reconciled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my understanding (following the understanding of others of course), nutrient limitation is not a fixed cap, but under biological control, expressable as a “C cost for nutrient uptake”. On infertile soils, this cost is generally higher. Be it because of low pH (which directly affects soil chemistry, nutrient availability and microbial activity) or because of soil texture (affecting nutrient retention, resistance to root growth, etc.) or other parameters. If an ecosystem is “limited” by, for example, N (i.e., no growth stimulation by adding P or elevating CO2), then the cost for taking up N is infinite. In that respect, the concept of a C cost (reflected in Cex and BP:GPP) is a generalization of the Liebig-type limitation concept, and is also able to integrate other factors that determine soil fertility (cost is as a function of pH, …).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is nutrient limitation just a question of C cost and thus energy availability? (Radiation energy is converted by photosynthesis to labile C, the fuel for any plant function). Maybe this is indeed the case for limitation by N. Obviously, there is no limit (other than energy) to biological control of N availability through converting N2 into reactive forms. In view of the ever-increasing N inputs through atmospheric deposition, reactive N, previously created by fossil fuel combustion, N limitation even seems to be relieved “for free” in affected ecosystems. This is different for P limitation. P doesn’t have a gaseous phase and is merely rock-derived. Also atmospheric deposition is very small, and the acceleration of anthropogenic inputs of reactive P lags behind the one for N (Penuelas et al., 2013). Once made available to plants, P recycling in ecosystems is highly conservative: only very small losses occur because it’s very costly for plants to accrue new P once it’s lost. The N cycle is much more leaky – N seems to be cheaper. Up to 25% of BP is fuelled by new inputs in the tropics (Cleveland et al., 2013). Taken together, it seems like enhanced demand for N under increasing CO2 should be met. No? On the other hand, P may impose much more of a limitation to future C uptake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of my research is to investigate the C cost for nutrient uptake. What soil fertility parameters have to be taken into account to accurately predict observed gradients in biomass production efficiency and above- versus below-ground allocation patterns. And what is the implication of biological control – taking into account such C cost effects – on the future of the land C sink? Please stay tuned …&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Big N Question: What controls rates of nitrogen fixation and losses?</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/nquestion/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 13:35:04 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/post/nquestion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we have to start with the notion that, on the long term, N losses from ecosystems via gaseous and leaching pathways have to be compensated by N inputs. Natural, that is non-human affected, N inputs are small and have been shown not to be sufficient to explain the measured N balance. Biological N fixation (BNF) must account for the remainder. However, drawing a complete picture of the N budget in terrestrial ecosystems has been notoriously difficult, because BNF is practically impossible to measure and estimated rates of global BNF range from around 200 TgN (Cleveland et al., 1999) to 58 TgN (Vitousek et al., 2013). Today, research is stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of understanding of the amount, but also of the controls on BNF introduces a “wildcard” for carbon (C) cycle projections under future climate change. Early C-only vegetation models suggested massive C sequestration under rising atmospheric CO2. However, for every C fixed into organic compounds, a relatively tightly constrained amount of N is required. But where does this N come from? Hungate et al. (2003) argued that these C-only model’s predictions were unrealistic because the implied additional N required for C sequestration would have to be provided by additional BNF, and that the required amounts of additional BNF were not “realistic”. But what is realistic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, vegetation models have been developed with the aim of introducing more “realism”. One such aspect is the coupling of C and N cycles. Indeed, this new generation of models generally does suggest less C sequestration, mostly for reasons of progressive N limitation (PNL) (Luo et al., 2004), meaning that additional N fixed in organic compounds leads to a depletion of N availability in soils because ecosystems can’t bring in enough N and thus run into a PNL. Is this realistic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem manipulation experiments and observations along gradients of varying N availability draw a different picture. The C allocation of plants appears to be flexible and responding to the availability of nutrients in the soil. Symbiotic associations between plants and mycorrhiza (root fungi) and N-fixing bacteria are away for plants to overcome nutrient shortage. However, these come at a cost of feeding C to symbionts. Also the “blind” exudation of labile C by plants into the soil stimulates microbial soil decomposition and N mineralisation and thus improves N availability. Apparently, getting enough N is not impossible but is also not free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;N cycling in land ecosystems. Reference state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;N cycling in land ecosystems. N-limited state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, a way of advancing the mechanistic understanding of the controls on N fixation could be by looking at the ecosystem energy economy – that is the C economy. N fixation is a particularly costly option to acquire N. Feeding the nitrogenase enzyme to break up the sturdy N2 bond is expensive. Modeling these trade-offs is one of the big goals of my work here at Colin Prentice’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What observations can be used to test such modeling approaches? Free Air CO2Enrichment (FACE) experiments have generated plenty of data to gain a better insight into C allocation changes under rising CO2. And indeed, more N appears to get bound into plant biomass when photosynthesis increases. However, knowing where this additional N is coming from remains unresolved. Either, it’s provided by accelerated soil organic matter decomposition, stimulated by more below-ground plant C allocation, or it’s brought in from the atmosphere via BNF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the first option is the case, then what happens to soil organic matter (SOM) stocks under continuing CO2 increase in the decades and centuries to come? A way to gain a better understanding of ecosystem responses to large-scale environmental change is to look into the past. The shift from the last ice age to the present warm period provides an analogue for future climate change (although from a different background and at a much slower pace). Again, if no additional N was brought into ecosystems back then, SOM stocks would have had to be tapped. Did they decrease indeed? Also, if no additional N was brought in, then ecosystems would indeed have run into a progressive N limitation. This would also imply that inorganic N stocks were depleted and lead to much less gaseous N losses and hence N2O emissions. Is this the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spahni et al. (in prep.) now show that terrestrial N2O emissions did indeed increase as CO2went up after the last ice age. This may be interpreted as a strong indication that no such PNL occurred. Hence, BNF must have increased along with the demand for N as ecosystems sequestered more C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that measurements of BNF are notoriously difficult but there are other, indirect constraints on how ecosystems respond to changes in N availability. Apart from manipulation experiments, analyses along environmental gradients, and evidence from palaeo-information, also the isotopic composition of 15N/14N may be used to estimate rates BNF. All this data has to be exploited to constrain models and get a better understanding of whether BNF increases in the future and permits more C to be sequestered in land ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
