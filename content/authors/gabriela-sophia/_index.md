I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and the Institute of Geography at the University of Bern. My research focuses on investigating the implications of a dynamic nutrient resorption scheme in the QUINCY model when we simulate biogeochemical cycles and future plant growth in the face of global changes. My approach includes global meta-analysis of nutrient resorption and ecosystem model development.
