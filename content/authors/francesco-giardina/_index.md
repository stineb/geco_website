I am an environmental engineer and PhD candidate at ETH Zürich. I investigate how plants mediate climate change in the terrestrial water and carbon cycles. My areas of interests include land-atmosphere feedbacks, applied machine learning and ecohydrology. 

I enjoy challenging myself in international experiences and learning across fields. Besides academia, I have work experience in international cooperation and in the private sector. My passion for communication and cultural curiosity pushed me to achieve fluency in English, French and Spanish (besides Italian!).

I am strongly motivated to make a positive impact towards the protection of threatened ecosystems and biodiversity.
