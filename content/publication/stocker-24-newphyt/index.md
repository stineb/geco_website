abstract: Summary Interactions between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in terrestrial
  ecosystems are simulated in advanced vegetation models, yet methodologies vary widely,
  leading to divergent simulations of past land C balance trends. This underscores
  the need to reassess our understanding of ecosystem processes, given recent theoretical
  advancements and empirical data. We review current knowledge, emphasising evidence
  from experiments and trait data compilations for vegetation responses to CO2 and
  N input, alongside theoretical and ecological principles for modelling. N fertilisation
  increases leaf N content but inconsistently enhances leaf-level photosynthetic capacity.
  Whole-plant responses include increased leaf area and biomass, with reduced root
  allocation and increased aboveground biomass. Elevated atmospheric CO2 also boosts
  leaf area and biomass but intensifies belowground allocation, depleting soil N and
  likely reducing N losses. Global leaf traits data confirm these findings, indicating
  that soil N availability influences leaf N content more than photosynthetic capacity.
  A demonstration model based on the functional balance hypothesis accurately predicts
  responses to N and CO2 fertilisation on tissue allocation, growth and biomass, offering
  a path to reduce uncertainty in global C cycle projections.
