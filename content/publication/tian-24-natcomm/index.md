abstract: Global patterns of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry have
  been interpreted as reflecting phenotypic plasticity in response to the environment,
  or as an overriding effect of the distribution of species growing in their biogeochemical
  niches. Here, we balance these contrasting views. We compile a global dataset of
  36,413 paired observations of leaf N and P concentrations, taxonomy and 45 environmental
  covariates, covering 7,549 sites and 3,700 species, to investigate how species identity
  and environmental variables control variations in mass-based leaf N and P concentrations,
  and the N:P ratio. We find within-species variation contributes around half of the
  total variation, with 29%, 31%, and 22% of leaf N, P, and N:P variation, respectively,
  explained by environmental variables. Within-species plasticity along environmental
  gradients varies across species and is highest for leaf N:P and lowest for leaf
  N. We identified effects of environmental variables on within-species variation
  using random forest models, whereas effects were largely missed by widely used linear
  mixed-effect models. Our analysis demonstrates a substantial influence of the environment
  in driving plastic responses of leaf N, P, and N:P within species, which challenges
  reports of a fixed biogeochemical niche and the overriding importance of species
  distributions in shaping global patterns of leaf N and P.
