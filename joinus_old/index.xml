      <title>Bachelor thesis - Soil texture for ET modelling</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/soiltext_et/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), i.e., the uptake of CO2 by terrestrial plants, is often limited by the availability of soil water for evapotranspiration (ET). The amount of water a plant can take up from the soil depends on the soil texture, the depth of plant roots, and the storage capacity of the soil in the plantâ€™s rooting zone. While long-term measurements of GPP and ET are available from sites across the globe (called the FLUXNET network), soil texture properties are not available in a common database. This project aims to assemble a datset of soil properties and plant traits at FLUXNET sites, and use it to predict ET over daily and weekly timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this project are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assemble data on soil properties and traits at FLUXNET sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibrate an existing water balance model based on its predictions of top-soil moisture content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict ET and cumulative water deficits and validate the same with flux data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most important: High motivation to work on questions related to land-atmosphere exchange and the carbon cycle - everything else can be learned!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interest in working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with R or other data science tools are an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Master thesis - Modelling optimal acclimation across canopy gradients</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/canopy_gradients/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 09:09:34 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/canopy_gradients/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis is determined by the acclimation of leaves to the prevailing light environment. In dense forests, light intensity decreases exponentially as we go from the top of the canopy towards the ground, as light is absorbed and scattered by leaves. However, the acclimated photosynthetic capacity of understorey leaves is higher than what we would expect based on the exponential decay of light. This is because these leaves acclimate to sun-flecks - small flecks of sunlight appear in understory due to gaps in the canopy, and because of the movement of the sun through the sky. Therefore, predicting the acclimation of understorey leaves requires considering the variability in light availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this project are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To quantify the variability in direct and diffuse sunlight in the understorey, either using either a radiative transfer model, or using fat-tailed probability distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To use the P-model of photosynthesis to predict the optimal acclimation of photosynthetic capacity given the distribution of light intensity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To test the model predictions with data on canopy gradients from the CH-Lae site and possibly from the Netravali site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most important: High motivation to work on questions related to plant physiology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of mathematical modelling and a keen interest to delve deeper into modelling and programming (R, Fortran)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working with R or other data science tools are a prerequisite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The student writes the thesis in English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods&#34;&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implement the P-model (or some concept of optimality) in SPA (or any other model that simulates light gradient in canopy) at different levels of canopy depth and predict within-canopy gradients in photosynthetic capacity, leaf N, and LMA.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Master thesis - Global evapotranspiration modelling</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/global_et/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), i.e., the uptake of CO2 by terrestrial plants, is often limited by the availability of soil water. The amount of water a plant can take up from the soil depends on the soil texture, the depth of plant roots, and the storage capacity of the soil in the plantâ€™s rooting zone. Global vegetation models typically only consider moisture content in the top 2m of soil, which is often not representative of the moisture conditions actually experienced by plants. In recent research, a more accurate global map of root-zone water storage capacity has been developed. This project aims at predicting and analyzing the properties of global evapo-transpiration (ET) based on this new map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this project are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend a soil water balance model being developed in Prof. Stockerâ€™s group to predict ET based on root-zone water storage capacity (RZWC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive the model at a global scale using a recently-developed map of RZWC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the interannual/intraannual variability in ET, test model predictions against the Budyko relationship, and test memory effects (due to water storage) on ET.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Master thesis - Droughts in the last millennium</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/cwd_millennium/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:36:01 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a current scientific debate if the intensity of the recent 2003, 2015, and 2018 droughts is exceptional in the context of the last millennium. Based on tree-ring reconstructions, some authors find them to be within the range of natural variability (Ionita et al. 2021), while others describe them to be unprecedented (BÃ¼ntgen et al. 2021). Our new climate reconstructions, generated by data-informed climate model simulations enable a testing of these hypotheses (Hand et al., 2023).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aim&#34;&gt;Aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this thesis is the analysis of droughts in our new climate reconstruction, which combines various kinds of direct and indirect observations with model simulations since 1420 CE. The drought magnitude will be quantified by considering cumulative water deficits and the long-term statistics of drought event magnitudes will be established. The climate reconstruction (from observations-informed climate model simulations) would allow to study also possible causes like Atlantic sea surface temperature variability or shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, plants have adapted their stomatal regulation to increase the water-use efficiency (WUE) at the leaf level. Another driver of plant transpiration is foliage surface area, and trends in land surface greenness are thus partly linked by enhanced WUE under elevated CO2. As climate change progresses, it is critical to understand the responses of terrestrial ecosystems and surface-atmosphere exchanges of CO2 and water vapour to global environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to model spatial and seasonal variations in WUE to predict evapotranspiration (ET) within an established global photosynthesis and acclimation model (productivity model or simply P-model; Stocker et al. 2020). The core of this model employs a principle of eco-evolutionary optimality to simulate acclimation of photosynthesis and transpiration based on the trade-off between costs and benefits from water loss and C assimilation. You will use observed root zone moisture storage capacity (SR) to model ET at FLUXNET sites and investigate predictions under progressing droughts. We expect that using the combination of the two key quantities WUE and SR, which are under plant-control and subject to different acclimation and adaptation across the Earth?s climate zones, will improve global ET predictions. It has been demonstrated that rooting zone adapts its extent as a function of the phase lag between peak seasonal radiation and precipitation. Following this framework, we will investigate the effect of a spatially varying rooting depth on the ratio of actual ET over precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis is a great starting point for mechanistic ecosystem modelling and working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere. Basic experience with working with R, Python, Fortran, or other programming languages are a requirement. You may start as soon as you like. Please contact me directly if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to carry out this thesis in teamwork, where the partner thesis would implement a predictive model based on machine-learning instead of a mechanistic model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human land use and land use change (LULUC) has transformed the Earth surface and is contributing to the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and climate change. In contrast to fossil fuel combustion, LULUC has potentially been an agent of Earth system transformation already before the Industrial period. Indeed, several prominent features in ice core records of the past 10,000 years have been linked to the rise and collapse of civilizations. However, establishing causal links and understanding the role of pre-industrial human societies in the Earth system has been challenging. Emerging past LULUC reconstructions combine insights from multiple disciplines (Archaeology, Earth system science, Land use Science and Geography) and provide a new basis for simulating impacts with Earth System Models. This is where you step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will use the latest reconstructions of Holocene LULUC from the PAGES Landcover6K working group (&lt;a href=&#34;http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/landcover6k/intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/landcover6k/intro,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://stineb.github.io/holoLU_lc6k/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://stineb.github.io/holoLU_lc6k/index.html&lt;/a&gt;) to run a set of global model simulations for evaluating impacts of pre-industrial LULUC on the terrestrial carbon balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis is a great starting point for working with global Earth system and vegetation models and large spatial datasets, and for linking disciplines. Experience with programming is an advantage and your eagerness to learn a prerequisite. You may start as soon as you like.
