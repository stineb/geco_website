Here, we predict the spatial and temporal variations of land surface reflectance and vegetation greenness, measuring the density of green vegetation and active foliage area, conditioned on current and past weather and the local topography. We train two alternative recurrent deep learning models that combine Long Short-Term Memory cells with convolutional layers (ConvLSTM) for forecasting the spatially resolved deviation of surface reflectance across a heterogeneous landscape from a specified initial state. Using data from diverse ecosystems and land cover types across Europe and following a standardized model evaluation framework (EarthNet2021 Challenge), our results indicate increased performance in predicting surface greenness during extreme drought events of the models presented here, compared to currently published benchmarks. This demonstrates how deep learning methods for optical Earth observation time series enable an early-warning of vegetation responses to the impacts of climatic extreme events, such as the drought-related loss of green foliage.","tags":["ConLSTM","ConvLSTM","drought impact","Drought impact forecasting","EarthNet","EarthNet2021","NDVI","Sentinel-2"],"title":"Enhanced prediction of vegetation responses to extreme drought using deep learning and Earth observation data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":null,"content":"Institute of Geography and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern\nStart of employment: 01.09.2024 (latest)\nTemporary employment\nOur group for Geocomputation and Earth Observation develops new model and data integration methods to gain a mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems, water-carbon coupling, and forest responses to climate change.

Such temporal geospatial data often comes in the form of multiple files that contain the data of a single time step - in the form of a geospatial map - or in the form of files that each contain the data of a subset of the time steps. This is a problem for analyses and modelling that rely on having access to the whole time series data. To obtain the whole time series, we have to read all files into memory and then run the analyses. In practice, this is often not possible due to memory limitations. What can we do?\nWe have to open each file, read a subset of the data, close the file, and open the next one and “stitch” the data together along the time axis. Then, repeat this to read the remaining subsets of the data to finally have time series of all geospatial units (usually pixels). This creates a burdensome computational overhead and involves lots of programming. Especially if the analyses are to be carried out in parallel for the spatial units.\nThe {map2tidy} R package solves this problem.\nThe solution The function map2tidy of our {map2tidy} R package takes a vector of file names (full paths) of NetCDF files containing geospatial data and returns a tidy data frame where each row represents one pixel of the geospatial (raster) data and the complete time series of each pixel is contained as a nested data frame in the column data.

We want to know this for example for putting the human perturbation of the global N cycle into context or as a target for models of the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, the amount of N taken up by plants is practically impossible to measure in the field. We therefore took an indirect approach to estimating this quantity. By knowing the annual total biomass production, the N content of new biomass, and the amount of N retained by plants when they shed their leaves (resorbing N causes leaves to turn yellow in autumn). We gathered these data from a large number of individual published field studies and complemented previously published data compilations. We further accounted for how these observed variables vary globally in relation to the environment. Based on the resulting models, we scaled each of these components (biomass production, N content, and resorption) to obtain global maps and then combined them to calculate the N uptake flux - across the globe.\nGlobal distribution of annual nitrogen uptake by vegetation. Figure from Peng et al. (2023). Perhaps the most important finding, apart from the numbers (global total N uptake is estimated to 950 Tg N/year), is the amount of N used per biomass produced varies most strongly in relation to the share of biomass production in leaves, roots, and wood - and less so in relation to these tissues’ N content.

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide has been reported to enhance photosynthesis and tree growth rates. Different studies have reported increased tree growth globally over the last decades (Brienen et al., 2015; Hubau et al., 2020) but the implications for long-term carbon storage in forests remain unknown. Tree growth enhancement could be translated into an increase in biomass stocks or could be associated with a reduction in tree longevity, compensating for any potential change in biomass, as has been established by the grow-fast-die-young hypothesis (GFDY). In our study recently published in AGU Advances (Marqués et al., 2023), we investigated whether accelerated tree growth leads to increased biomass stocks. These links between growth and biomass have been difficult to study because on the one hand, it is an observational challenge - what we can record today is very much affected by the history of the stand development and past disturbances. In the other hand, although we know which mechanisms are at play, scarce empirical evidence exists for how changing drivers affect these processes making it difficult to evaluate their net effect.\nWe can formulate this question in quantitative terms asking what is the relative change in biomass (dB/B) per unit relative change in growth (dG/G)? We can start with a NULL model and consider that the relative change in growth is equal to the relative change in biomass, that is the 1:1 line. We refer to this linear response as the constant turnover where biomass at the steady state depends on growth and on turnover rate. But based on what we know from observations and how we understand the mechanisms, we can expect an accelerated turnover, which leads to a non-linear response where the relative increase in biomass is smaller than the relative increase in growth. During stand development, a large number of small seedlings grow to the point that canopy closes and mutual shading sets in. As a consequence, smaller individuals suffer light limitation and at some point die. So, an emergent relationship appears between the number of individuals in the stand and the average size. In the log-log scale, this leads to a negative relation called the self-thinning line (STL). As the stands mature, density-driven mortality kicks in and the surviving trees continue growing. If the GFDY hypothesis holds, this will imply that trees just progress faster along the STL with a constant self-thinning where no or only a very small change in stand-level biomass would result from enhanced growth.\nConceptual model of biomass and STL responses to tree growth enhancement. We combined forest observations and model simulations to evaluate to what extent tree growth enhancements lead to persistent increases in forest biomass stocks. First, we used long-term forest data from unmanaged stands in Switzerland to evaluate responses of the STL to growth enhancement. We selected only data from plots where no management was recorded during and before the censuses. To minimize the effects of natural past disturbances, we further retained only plots for which the stand density was in the upper 75th percentile of average plot-level tree sizes. We found that the negative relationship between the number and the size of trees has not remained stable but shifted upward over time, i.e., for a given size, forest stands tend to have become denser over time. Further, the self-thinning relationship exhibited a change as a function of growth anomalies, derived from stand-level growth, indicating also a spatial change across forest plots. The positive effect of both calendar year and growth anomalies on the intercept of the STL indicates that the relationship between biomass and density has not been stationary but has shifted significantly over the past decades.\nSTL changes as a function of time and growth in unmanaged Swiss forests. Second, using a cohort-based vegetation demography model (BiomeE, Weng et al. 2015) to explore under which conditions persistent biomass stock increases result from growth enhancements. BiomeE simulates leaf-level ecophysiology, individual-level competition for light and soil resources, forest structural dynamics, and biogeochemical processes. To test the GFDY hypothesis, a U-shape mortality was specified with higher mortality rates for the smaller and younger understory cohorts and a size-dependent mortality rate for the upper-canopy trees. We also evaluate the influence of the mortality curvature on the growth-biomass link by testing different mortality parameterizations. To simulate tree growth enhancement, we applied a step-increase in the light use efficiency (LUE) of photosynthesis by two levels (+15% and +30%). Higher LUE and a resulting tree-level growth enhancement represent effects of a growing season extension, enhanced nutrient inputs, relieving of cold-limitation, or increasing atmospheric CO2.

While seemingly inconspicuous, it holds the key to understanding the inner workings of an ecosystem’s carbon and water cycle and the processes that drive them. Imagine climate scientists striving for precision in their vegetation models or aiming to decipher intricate ecological relationships. Leaf temperature is the critical piece of this puzzle.\nThe debate surrounding leaf thermoregulation, the question of how leaves manage their temperature, has sparked a considerable discussions. Can plants actively control their leaf temperature? If so, when and how? This debate remains unsettled, with compelling arguments on both sides.\nAdding to this intrigue is the application of eco-evolutionary optimality theory (EEO). EEO leverages natural selection’s power to shape vegetation patterns based on climate. It suggests that ecosystem traits are outcomes of climate-driven evolution. By applying EEO principles, we can predict essential photosynthetic processes solely from environmental data, revolutionizing Earth system models. And so, they might also provide important insights in thermoregulation.\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The quest to decipher leaf temperature continues with diverse data sources and methods, uniting ecologists, data scientists, and climate experts. This interdisciplinary endeavor makes leaf temperature a captivating field to explore.\nIf you’re captivated by this riddle of leaf temperature and its profound implications for our understanding of ecosystems, delve deeper into this subject through our online tutorial.

The acquisition, management, distribution, and analysis of such data is not trivial and can take up the majority of the time in modelling projects. This calls for frameworks and standardised pipelines for large EO datasets. In response to some of these challenges, multiple initiatives [1,2,3] propose data cubes (or minicubes) as a structured EO data catalogue.\nA data cube refers to a multi-dimensional data structure, which naturally arises with EO data where there are both the spatial and temporal components. Ideally, multiple heterogenous data sources can be combined in a minicube. Discrepancies in spatial resolutions are dealt with by regridding and resampling the various products to a common grid. Temporal aggregations can also be performed to match different timeseries.\nExpanding Earthnet’s minicuber The earthnet-minicuber python package [3] offers the possibility to obtain data cubes for satellite imagery and some other EO sources, but is primarily tailored towards Sentinel-2 imagery. In an effort to push forward data cubes for environmental and climate impact modelling, we extend the code such as to allow better integration of ERA5 climate reanalysis data.\nThe additions to the code now allow a better combination of Sentinel-2 and ERA5 data in the minicubes. It is possible to download ERA5 hourly variables via Amazon Web Servives, and automatically match the temporal frequency of Sentinel-2 which is 5-daily. The type of aggregation can be defined for each variable depening on the user’s preference and the use-case.\nYou can access the updated minicuber code here:\nhttps://github.com/geco-bern/earthnet-minicuber\nWith minicubes available, the creation of pixel-level datasets ready for machine learning applications is the natural next step. Code has also been developed to generate these datasets after downloading minicubes. In particular, one can integrate custom geospatial data to the minicube after having retrieved EO data online (for example, specific raster layers). We also offer a possibility to deal with cloud removal in the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Finally, context-target pairs of desired lengths can be extracted from the minicubes and are stored as compressed numpy arrays.\nFor more on generating datasets from minicubes, check out the code here:\nhttps://github.com/seleneledain/forest_drought_forecasting/tree/main\nOpen Data Cube https://www.opendatacube.org/ Swiss Data Cube https://www.swissdatacube.org/ EarthNet Challenge https://www.earthnet.tech/ ","date":1688342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688342400,"objectID":"3db7554f13e94200fcd11b87f1186992","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/post/minicuber/","publishdate":"2023-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/minicuber/","section":"post","summary":"With large collections of Earth Observation (EO) data becoming increasingly available, new possibilities to better understand and quantify environmental changes also arise.

Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity, leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme events.","tags":["Amazon","Plant-FATE"],"title":"Competition for light can drive adverse species-composition shifts in the Amazon Forest under elevated CO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantin M.

However, their scope is limited in space and time due to cost and labour intensity. This makes generalising results from such experiments difficult, which creates a conceptual gap between local scale process understanding and global scale future predictions. Recent efforts have seen results from such experiments used in combination with dynamic global vegetation models, most commonly to evaluate model predictions under global change drivers. However, there is much more potential in combining models and experiments. Here, we discuss the value and potential of a workflow for using ecosystem experiments together with process-based models to enhance the potential of both. We suggest that models can be used prior to the start of an experiment to generate hypotheses, identify data needs and in general guide experimental design. Models, when adequately constrained with observations, can also predict variables which are difficult to measure frequently or at all, and together with the data can provide a more complete picture of ecosystem states. Finally, models can be used to help generalise the experimental results in space and time, by providing a framework in which process understanding derived from site-level experiments can be incorporated. We also discuss the potential for using manipulative experiments together with models in formalised model-data integration frameworks for parameter estimation and model selection, a path made possible by the increasing number of ecosystem experiments and diverse observation streams. The ideas presented here can provide a roadmap to future experiment - model studies.textless/ptextgreater","tags":["EME"],"title":"Ideas and perspectives: Beyond model evaluation \u0026ndash; combining experiments and models to advance terrestrial ecosystem science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaideep Joshi"],"categories":null,"content":"Background Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), i.e., the uptake of CO2 by terrestrial plants, is often limited by the availability of soil water for evapotranspiration (ET).

This variability between years is called the interannual variability (IAV) of GPP and the reasons for why GPP can change substantially from year to year are unclear. From a global scale analysis, we know that the seasonal cycles in precipitation and temperature in semi-arid ecoystems contribute substantially to the global IAV of GPP, highlighting the role of water and heat. We also know that even a few unusual hours in a total year can contribute disproportionately more to an ecosystems annual carbon uptake. For example, just 2% of unusually hot hours can account for ca. 10% of an ecosystems’ total annual GPP. Considering an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events under climate change, a better quantification and characterisation of GPP extremes is crucial to estimate the future global carbon balance.\nAim The goal of this project is to quantify the role of GPP extremes on an ecosystem’s carbon uptake, using FLUXNET data (half-hourly measured land-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide). The first aim is to identify years that show GPP extremes, that is, anomalies in their annual total GPP. Then, a suitable method to assess the effect of extreme days within these anomalous years on the year’s total GPP is explored by (e.g., using a Gini index). Further questions may cover investigating the difference across globally distributed sites or comparing observed against modelled GPP to identify the drivers of GPP extremes.\nRequirements Most important: High motivation to work on questions related to land-atmosphere exchange and the carbon cycle - everything else can be learned!

However, the advance of the start-of-the-season (SOS) can induce false springs, i.e., a stretch of unexpectedly warmer temperatures in late winter/early spring followed by sudden freezing events. These frost events after the SOS can affect the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems and have important environmental and economic consequences. Still, there is little consensus on how frost events change under global warming and the implications. Therefore, it is relevant to understand the occurrence of frost events once the growing season has started and how they change among regions in temperate and boreal forests.\nAim The goal of this project is to identify when the frost events happen after the SOS and quantify their impact on carbon fluxes. The student will characterize the SOS using phenological measurements and ecosystem-level photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP). Daily minimum temperatures will be used to calculate the number of frost events. The project design includes combining ground observations, eddy covariance flux measurements, remote sensing data and global climate datasets.\nRequirements The student is motivated to work with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere.

Here are some thoughts I wanted to share with fellow snow enthusiasts and others about what cumulative emissions and tipping points mean for the framing of the need for climate action.\nThis blog was originially published in German for Protect Our Winters, Switzerland.\nThe dramatic images of ski slopes in the Alps, desperately groomed with artificial snow and eerily set against a backdrop of green mountains, offer a glimpse of the future. And the future strikes faster than many of us expected. At stake here is what we hold dear. These images are a wake-up call to keep the world the way we love it as outdoor enthusiasts, skiers, snowboarders, climbers, sledders, skaters, snow hikers, and other snow lovers. We are reminded that the climate is changing, that the snow is receding, and that the world as we know it is melting away and is becoming a memory of our past. It’s also a wake-up call to protect our winters. POW shows that we can. Our enthusiasm for nature drives us to preserve it. Climate protection and winter sports belong together.\nSnow depth in Switzerland as a percentage of the long-term average for the respective day of the year. From SLF whiterisk.ch, 21 February 2023. The map shows that the current snow depth is only between 0 and 60% of the typical depth observed around the 21st of February (average across a 30-year reference period, see here).\nIt is clear that our enthusiasm for the crude wilderness and the cold winter leaves traces. There is no life without traces. That’s POW’s message: we can and should strive to reduce our impact on the planet and advocate for change, even as we acknowledge that we are not perfect and leave traces. We are imperfect advocates. Yet it is better to be imperfect advocates than to bury our heads in the sand. This message speaks to me as an avid skier, as someone who feels almost patriotic when the alpenglühen of the snow-covered Alps sets in (their fiery appearance of the snow-covered mountains in the setting sun). And it speaks to me as a climate scientist. Because it makes sense - scientifically! Here’s why.\nSuppose I were a professional skier (which I dreamed of being at some point in my life, and perhaps even today). I decide to avoid two of my several planned flights this year. This benefits the climate just as much as if you decide not to book your only two planned flights for your next vacation and celebrate an absolutely flight-free year. Although the latter seems purer, more determined, feels more rewarding, and definitely makes for a better-sounding Instagram post, the climate doesn’t care. A ton of CO2 avoided is a ton avoided - no matter by whom, when, or where on Earth.\nTop: The more CO2 is emitted, the more the mean global temperature rises. CO2 is mainly emitted by fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. The curve is composed of the relationship between the summed CO2 production and the temperature increase since 1850. The data are observations for the past (black line and grey band) and from projections with climate models following different future scenarios (SSP1-1.9 is a scenario with rapid reduction of CO2 emissions, SSP5-8.5 is a scenario of strong increase of CO2 emissions). Graphic adapted from IPCC AR6 WG1 Summary for Policymakers.\nClimate research shows that each ton of CO2 we emit causes a certain amount of global warming (see graph above). The warming per ton of CO2 emitted is roughly constant. Observations and projections from climate models show that the average global temperature is increasing with the sum of all CO2 emissions since 1850.\nThis means that every ton, every gram of CO2 counts. Every ton contributes equally to climate heating. The climate doesn’t care when, where, and anyway by whom the CO2 is emitted. A ton avoided is a ton avoided. This fact contains an important message: it is never too late to avoid a ton of CO2 emissions. Every generation must work to leave the carbon in the ground and save the remaining forests and other carbon-rich ecosystems from their destruction. It is never too late. However, we must continue climate action efforts - starting now and for all generations to come.\nWe are not the last generation to save the planet. We are the first of many future generations to make a change.\nIt also means that we are not the last generation to make a difference. On the contrary. We are the first of many generations to make a change. We are the first generation that can seriously turn the wheel in terms of personal life choices and political change that we can set in motion by voting, electing politicians, and by protesting. Here in Switzerland, where I live, we are the first generation to vote on important climate legislation, and we have a second chance this year with the upcoming vote on the counter-proposal to the Glacier Initiative.\nIt would be fatal to abandon efforts even if the world has warmed by 1.5 degrees Celsius - …","date":1676929024,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676929024,"objectID":"f85a87a23ebec79bf95e9e4dc60e41e4","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/post/every-ton/","publishdate":"2023-02-20T22:37:04+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/every-ton/","section":"post","summary":"We are not the last generation that can make a change but the first of many that must.

It is an important property in determining ecosystem photosynthesis and evapotranspiration in rain-free periods and controls the sensitivity of ecosystems and their carbon and water fluxes to drought conditions. While S0 is an essential parameter of land surface models, it is almost impossible to measure in the field, at least not across large scales. Considering that S0 is also highly variable across small spatial scales, and that it varies massively between species and between different biomes, it is really a sort of elephant in the room for large-scale drought impacts modeling.\nPrevious studies have estimated the root zone water storage capacity based on a water mass balance approach where the parallel time series of evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (P) are considered (e.g., Gao et al., 2014). This approach was also the starting point of our analysis, which has been published today in Nature Geoscience (Stocker et al., 2023). Using remote sensing and climate reanalysis data, provided at ~5 km resolution, we derived continuous daily time series of the cumulative water deficit (CWD) over the years 2003-2017 for each pixel across the globe. Knowing how much water is lost from the land surface during dry periods is the key for estimating how much locally stored water plants have access to. With this rationale, we calculated a first estimate for the global distribution of S0 , informed by extreme values of annual CWD maxima in each pixel.\nSpatial variation of the rooting zone water storage capacity, estimated by cumulative water deficit maxima. It should be noted that a key ingredient to such diagnosed S0 estimates is the ET data. The challenging aspect is that most remote sensing-based ET products make an assumption about S0 - either directly or indirectly - for determining the sensitivity of ET to a drying of the soil. Of course, when using such ET products, the diagnosed S0 just reflects assumptions embodied in the algorithm used for estimating ET. There is a clear risk for circularity. This made us search for ET estimates that are free of such an assumption. As an additional help in guiding our search for a suitable ET estimate was its performance when evaluated against local measurements. Our search identified a clear winner: ALEXI-ET (Hain \u0026amp; Anderson, 2017). Instead of relying on an a priori specified water stress function, it makes use of information gleaned from surface temperature remote sensing and parallel climate reanalysis. The ALEXI algorithm thus infers ET from the surface and atmospheric energy budget. Furthermore, our evaluation of different remote sensing-based ET products revealed that ALEXI-ET yields ET estimates that exhibit no systematic bias with the level of water stress - in contrast to the alternatives we tested. This gave us confidence to move ahead.\nThe next question we addressed was whether the CWD maxima reflect root zone dimensions or (just) the hydroclimate. Interpreting apparent CWD maxima as a reflection of the rooting depth implicitly assumes that the actual rooting zone water storage capacity is just large enough and roots just deep enough to yield the apparent water deficits in the dry season. Given the opportunity costs of building deep roots, such a sizing would be optimal from an eco-evolutionary perspective. To test whether this is the case, we looked at the vegetation activity and analyzed how it responds to water deficits. As a measure for vegetation activity, we focus on sun-induced fluorescence (SIF), normalized by incident solar radiation, and on the evaporative fraction, defined as ET divided by net radiation. Regressing vegetation activity against CWD yields information about the sensitivity of vegetation to water stress from which we estimated the CWD at which vegetation activity ceases. If this “cessation CWD” agrees with the magnitude of CWD extremes, we have a further indication that roots are indeed just deep enough to get the water needed to sustain rare drought events. And indeed, we found close correspondence between the two quantities.\nAs a further test of our remote sensing-based S0 estimates, we made use of a recently published comprehensive compilation of field data of rooting depths from over 5000 individual field observations across the globe and covering all major biomes (Tumber-Davila et al., 2022). Also at this scale, we found consistent patterns. The deepest roots are found where seasonal water deficits are largest and the shallowest roots are found in climates where annual CWD maxima are small. Interestingly, the largest root zone water storage capacities and rooting depths are diagnosed from space and observed in the field not in the driest climates, but in monsoonal climates and biomes with perennial plants and where (more or less) green vegetation cover is maintained throughout the year.

Wetland loss has been concentrated in Europe, the United States and China, and rapidly expanded during the mid-twentieth century.

In an effort to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO2, temperature, nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence. These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment responses across 3,644 manipulation experiments at 1,145 sites, simulating elevated CO2, warming, nutrient addition and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration, and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database indicates that most experiments are short-term (one or few growing seasons), conducted in the USA, Europe or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground biomass.

Like all plants, trees have the magnificent capability to draw gaseous carbon dioxide from the air and turn it into hard touchable wood. But trees do not only need carbon to grow. Like humans, they need other nutrients to build their leaves, stems, and roots. A major nutrient to do so is nitrogen - another element well hidden from our eyes that actually makes up about 80% of our earth’s atmosphere.\nUnlike carbon dioxide, however, trees do no take up nitrogen through their leaves. Quite the opposite, in fact! They often rely on a tight friendship with tiny microorganisms that live attached or even within their roots. These microorganisms can access nitrogen through various ways, like absorbing it directly from the atmosphere, breaking up old plant debris, or even by chewing away on pieces of rocks.\nLooking at all the trees growing around us, one may think that the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen cannot be that complicated - trees seem to do it all the time, right? And yet, the current state of knowledge shows that this is no trivial question at all. And luckily so! This complex and fascinating interplay of our ecosystem’s carbon and nitrogen cycle is my PhD’s main research topic. This blog post is the beginning of what I call “A Song of Carbon and Nitrogen”, with obvious cultural reference to the great fantasy story.\nAll research must be founded on a grand overarching question that embodies its relevance for our life. Understanding the carbon-nitrogen cycle is of great interest because it directly affects our biosphere’s capability of coping with human-made climate change. More carbon dioxide and a warmer climate may sound nice for plants, and indeed the biosphere’s carbon uptake has increased over the past decades1.\nBut for how long will this be the case? Unfortunately, we just don’t know. Once plants are limited by nutrient availability, they no longer help us tackle climate change. In fact, the IPCC2 estimates that the feedback of the biosphere to rising CO2 (think of this feedback as “how much plants slow down climate change”) ranges from a strong negative feedback (this is good, plants take up a lot of carbon) to almost no feedback at all (this is bad, plants don’t help no more)3.\nSo, how can we calm our minds and find out whether plants (hopefully) continue to help us out? That is the grand challenge of my PhD. The song of carbon and nitrogen tells the story of each carbon and nitrogen atom. How trees take each of them up through air and soil, how they march through life and death as they bloom as leaves and decay as litter, how they get another chance at life thanks to tiny soil microbes that restart their life from anew. Who follows, and who leads? Who pushed and who drags?\nThe interactions of the carbon-nitrogen cycle are highly interwoven, complex to understand, and a mystery we need to solve to comprehend what may happen to our precious planet under the pressure of climate change. Although I have not yet settled on a precise formulation, the grand question of my PhD may sound something like this: What are the complex interactions of the carbon and nitrogen cycle in our ecosystems that determine whether the global biosphere will continue to aid us in our fight against climate change?\nDisclaimer: This blog post is part of Pascal’s PhD journey and was originally published here.\nSee Section 5.4.3 Climate Effect on Land Carbon Uptake in Chapter 5 of IPCC AR6 (Link) ↩︎\nIPCC: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ↩︎\nSee Figure 5.29b (land carbon response to CO2) in Chapter 5 of IPCC AR6 (Link) ↩︎\n","date":1673559424,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676929024,"objectID":"fc36e8711cc5ada915129af7c143ed5f","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/post/song-cn/","publishdate":"2023-01-12T22:37:04+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/song-cn/","section":"post","summary":"Part 1 - The Setting Have you ever looked at a forest and wondered about where all this wood comes from?

Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing-season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation—with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multidecadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales.

Quantifying water limitation effects on evapotranspiration (ET) is challenged by the heterogeneity of vegetation types, climate zones and vertically along the rooting zone. Here, we train deep neural networks using flux measurements to study ET responses to progressing drought conditions. We determine a water stress factor (fET) that isolates ET reductions from effects of atmospheric aridity and other covarying drivers. We regress fET against the cumulative water deficit, which reveals the control of whole-column moisture availability. We find a variety of ET responses to water stress. Responses range from rapid declines of fET to 10% of its water-unlimited rate at several savannah and grassland sites, to mild fET reductions in most forests, despite substantial water deficits. Most sensitive responses are found at the most arid and warm sites. A combination of regulation of stomatal and hydraulic conductance and access to belowground water reservoirs, whether in groundwater or deep soil moisture, could explain the different behaviors observed across sites. This variety of responses is not captured by a standard land surface model, likely reflecting simplifications in its representation of belowground water storage.","tags":["climate change","deep learning","drought","groundwater","rock moisture","root zone water storage capacity","soil moisture","vapor pressure deficit"],"title":"Diagnosing evapotranspiration responses to water deficit across biomes using deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunke Peng","Iain Colin Prentice","Keith J.

But the controls of key plant processes determining Nup and NUE, including BP, C and N allocation, tissue C:N ratios and N resorption efficiency (NRE), remain poorly known. We compiled measurements from 804 forest and grassland sites and derived regression models for each of these processes with growth temperature, vapour pressure deficit, stand age, soil C:N ratio, fAPAR (remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation) and growing-season average daily incident photosynthetic photon flux density (gPPFD; effectively the seasonal concentration of light availability, which increases polewards) as predictors. An empirical model for leaf N was based on optimal photosynthetic capacity (a function of gPPFD and climate) and observed leaf mass per area. The models were used to produce global maps of Nup and NUE. Global BP was estimated as 72 Pg C/year; Nup as 950 Tg N/year; and NUE as 76 g C/g N. Forest BP was found to increase with growth temperature and fAPAR and to decrease with stand age, soil C:N ratio and gPPFD. Forest NUE is controlled primarily by climate through its effect on C allocation—especially to leaves, being richer in N than other tissues. NUE is greater in colder climates, where N is less readily available, because below-ground allocation is increased. NUE is also greater in drier climates because leaf allocation is reduced. NRE is enhanced (further promoting NUE) in both cold and dry climates. Synthesis. These findings can provide observationally based benchmarks for model representations of C–N cycle coupling. State-of-the-art vegetation models in the TRENDY ensemble showed variable performance against these benchmarks, and models including coupled C–N cycling produced relatively poor simulations of Nup and NUE.","tags":["carbon","climate","data-driven model","global change ecology","nitrogen uptake","nitrogen use efficiency","stand age","terrestrial ecosystem"],"title":"Global terrestrial nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunpeng Luo","Arthur Gessler","Petra D'Odorico","Koen Hufkens","Benjamin D.

Here, we used eddy covariance-based GPP estimates from 39 forest sites that differ by their climate and dominant plant functional types. We used a mechanistic and an empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model to investigate the magnitude and environmental controls of delayed springtime photosynthesis resumption (DSPR) across sites. We found DSPR reduced ecosystem LUE by 30–70% at many, but not all site-years during spring. A significant depression of LUE was found not only in coniferous but also at deciduous forests and was related to combined high radiation and low minimum temperatures. By embedding cold-acclimation effects on LUE that considers the delayed effects of minimum temperatures, initial model bias in simulated springtime GPP was effectively resolved. This provides an approach to improve GPP estimates by considering physiological acclimation and enables more reliable simulations of photosynthesis in northern forests and projections in a warming climate.","tags":["cold acclimation","eddy covariance","gross primary productivity (GPP)","light use efficiency (LUE)","photoprotection","photosynthesis modelling","quantum yield","temperate and boreal forests"],"title":"Quantifying effects of cold acclimation and delayed springtime photosynthesis resumption in northern ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Marqués","Ensheng Weng","Harald Bugmann","David I.

Enhanced tree growth and stand-level biomass are often linked with a simultaneous increase in density-driven mortality and a reduction in tree longevity. Identifying empirical evidence regarding the balance between these processes is challenging due to the confounding effects of stand history, management, and environmental changes. Here, we investigate the link between growth and biomass via the negative relationship between average tree size and stand density (tree number per area). We find increasing stand density for a given mean tree size in unmanaged closed-canopy forests in Switzerland over the past six decades and a positive relationship between tree growth and stand density across forest plots—qualitatively consistent with our simulations using a mechanistic, cohort-resolving ecosystem model (BiomeE). Model simulations show that, in the absence of other disturbances, enhanced tree growth persistently increases biomass stocks despite simultaneous decreases in carbon residence time and tree longevity. However, the magnitude of simulated biomass changes for a given growth enhancement critically depends on the shape of the mortality functions. Our analyses reconcile reports of growth-induced reductions of tree longevity with model predictions of persistent biomass increases, and with our finding of trends toward denser forests in response to growth—also in mature stands.","tags":["biomass stocks","growth enhancement","growth-lifespan trade-offs","tree mortality","self-thinning","vegetation models"],"title":"Tree Growth Enhancement Drives a Persistent Biomass Gain in Unmanaged Temperate Forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":null,"content":" Main supervision: Prof. Dr. Benjamin Stocker, Dr. Jaideep Joshi Co-supervision: Dr. Antoine Cabon, WSL Birmensdorf\nForests currently represent a large carbon sink, offsetting a quarter of human CO2 emissions each year, bur large uncertainty remains on the future strength of this sink. Namely, vegetation models assume that tree growth is essentially limited by photosynthesis, but recent evidence suggests that currently unaccounted for biophysical limitations to tree growth by low temperatures and water stress can substantially decouple tree growth from photosynthesis. The degree to which biophysical limitations might slow down forest carbon storage is still unclear but has potentially critical implications for climate projections.\nThe objective of this project is to implement biophysical limitations to tree growth in an established mechanistic vegetation model in order to quantify the effect of these new controls on forest primary production.

First, we study gender bias among people leading ecosystem restoration initiatives in the three dimensions. Second, we assessed factors that could influence gender bias, including year, target ecosystem, and socioeconomic country development. Third, we analyzed whether the impact of scientific knowledge in society depends on the gender of the scientific team. Our results indicate that men were primary leaders in research, outreach, and practice initiatives in ecosystem restoration. There seems to be a trend over time toward equality in research, but gender inequality is still present in most types of ecosystems, with women leading more projects in more developed countries. The impact of scientific knowledge is independent of the author's gender, but research of male senior authors seems to reach society more easily. This broad perspective of inequality in the three dimensions can evolve toward gender equality, by applying gender approaches in restoration policies and initiatives.","tags":[],"title":"Gender bias in ecosystem restoration\\: from science to practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael McCarthy","Fabienne Meier","Simone Fatichi","Benjamin D.

Glaciers have provided vital fresh water to the region’s rivers, but the quantity, timing and sustainability of that provision remain unclear. Here we combine in-situ, remote sensing and climate reanalysis data to show that from 2010 to 2018 during the megadrought, unsustainable imbalance ablation of glaciers (ablation not balanced by new snowfall) strongly buffered the late-summer discharge of the Maipo River, a primary source of water to Santiago. If there had been no glaciers, water availability would have been reduced from December through May, with a 31 ± 19\\% decrease during March. Our results indicate that while the annual contributions of imbalance ablation to river discharge during the megadrought have been small compared to those from precipitation and sustainable balance ablation, they have nevertheless been a substantial input to a hydrological system that was already experiencing high water stress. The water-equivalent volume of imbalance ablation generated in the Maipo Basin between 2010 and 2018 was 740 × 106 m3 (19 ± 12 mm yr-1), approximately 3.4 times the capacity of the basin’s El Yeso Reservoir. This is equivalent to 14\\% of Santiago’s potable water use in that time, while total glacier ablation was equivalent to 59\\%. We show that glacier retreat will exacerbate river discharge deficits and further jeopardise water availability in central Chile if precipitation deficits endure, and conjecture that these effects will be amplified by climatic warming.","tags":["Glaciers","Megadrought","Chile","Streamflow","Sustainability","Water supply"],"title":"Glacier contributions to river discharge during the current Chilean megadrought","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chunjing Qiu","Philippe Ciais","Dan Zhu","Bertrand Guenet","Jinfeng Chang","Nitin Chaudhary","Thomas Kleinen","XinYu Li","Jurek M{\\\"u}ller","Yi Xi","Wenxin Zhang","Ashley Ballantyne","Simon C.

Another driver of plant transpiration is foliage surface area, and trends in land surface greenness are thus partly linked by enhanced WUE under elevated CO2. As climate change progresses, it is critical to understand the responses of terrestrial ecosystems and surface-atmosphere exchanges of CO2 and water vapour to global environmental change.\nThe objective of this project is to model spatial and seasonal variations in WUE to predict evapotranspiration (ET) within an established global photosynthesis and acclimation model (productivity model or simply P-model; Stocker et al. 2020). The core of this model employs a principle of eco-evolutionary optimality to simulate acclimation of photosynthesis and transpiration based on the trade-off between costs and benefits from water loss and C assimilation. You will use observed root zone moisture storage capacity (SR) to model ET at FLUXNET sites and investigate predictions under progressing droughts. We expect that using the combination of the two key quantities WUE and SR, which are under plant-control and subject to different acclimation and adaptation across the Earth?s climate zones, will improve global ET predictions. It has been demonstrated that rooting zone adapts its extent as a function of the phase lag between peak seasonal radiation and precipitation. Following this framework, we will investigate the effect of a spatially varying rooting depth on the ratio of actual ET over precipitation.\nThis thesis is a great starting point for mechanistic ecosystem modelling and working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere.

How trees acclimate to long-term soil moisture changes and whether these long-term changes alter trees’ sensitivity to short-term (day to months) variations of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture is largely unknown. Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed within a long-term (17 years) irrigation experiment in a drought-prone Scots pine-dominated forest in one of Switzerland’s driest areas on trees in naturally dry (control), irrigated, and ‘irrigation-stop’ (after 11 years of irrigation) conditions. Seventeen years of irrigation increased photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) and reduced gs sensitivity to increasing VPD and soil drying. Following irrigation-stop, gas exchange decreased only after 3 years. After 5 years, maximum carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron transport (Jmax) rates in irrigation-stop recovered to similar levels as to before the irrigation-stop. These results suggest that long-term release from soil drought reduces the sensitivity to VPD and that atmospheric constraints may play an increasingly important role in combination with soil drought.

The level of uncertainty in net LUC flux from process-based models is so high that it cannot be concluded that newer estimates are necessarily more reliable than older ones. Here, we examined net LUC flux estimates of Southeast Asia for the 1980s−2010s from older and newer sets of Dynamic Global Vegetation Model simulations (TRENDY v2 and v7, respectively), and forcing data used for running those simulations, along with two book-keeping estimates (H\u0026N and BLUE). These estimates yielded two contrasting historical LUC transitions, such that TRENDY v2 and H\u0026N showed a transition from increased emissions from the 1980s to 1990s to declining emissions in the 2000s, while TRENDY v7 and BLUE showed the opposite transition. We found that these contrasting transitions originated in the update of LUC forcing data, which reduced the loss of forest area during the 1990s. Further evaluation of remote sensing studies, atmospheric inversions, and the history of forestry and environmental policies in Southeast Asia supported the occurrence of peak emissions in the 1990s and declining thereafter. However, whether LUC emissions continue to decline in Southeast Asia remains uncertain as key processes in recent years, such as conversion of peat forest to oil-palm plantation, are yet to be represented in the forcing data, suggesting a need for further revision.","tags":["Southeast Asia","land-use changes","Dynamic Global Vegetation Models","book-keeping models","forest area","atmospheric inversions"],"title":"Are Land-Use Change Emissions in Southeast Asia Decreasing or Increasing?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

The instantaneous controls of leaf-level photosynthesis are well established, but there is still no consensus on the mechanisms by which canopy-level GPP depends on spatial and temporal variation in the environment. The standard model of photosynthesis provides a robust mechanistic representation for C3 species; however, additional assumptions are required to “scale up” from leaf to canopy. As a consequence, competing models make inconsistent predictions about how GPP will respond to continuing environmental change. This problem is addressed here by means of an empirical analysis of the light use efficiency (LUE) of GPP inferred from eddy covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements, in situ measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and remotely sensed estimates of the fraction of PAR (fAPAR) absorbed by the vegetation canopy. Focusing on LUE allows potential drivers of GPP to be separated from its overriding dependence on light. GPP data from over 100 sites, collated over 20 years and located in a range of biomes and climate zones, were extracted from the FLUXNET2015 database and combined with remotely sensed fAPAR data to estimate daily LUE. Daytime air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, diffuse fraction of solar radiation, and soil moisture were shown to be salient predictors of LUE in a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The same model design was fitted to site-based LUE estimates generated by 16 terrestrial ecosystem models. The published models showed wide variation in the shape, the strength, and even the sign of the environmental effects on modeled LUE. These findings highlight important model deficiencies and suggest a need to progress beyond simple “goodness of fit” comparisons of inferred and predicted carbon fluxes toward an approach focused on the functional responses of the underlying dependencies.","tags":["diffuse radiation","eddy covariance","FLUXNET","light use efficiency","soil moisture","temperature","terrestrial biosphere model","vapor pressure deficit"],"title":"Environmental controls on the light use efficiency of terrestrial gross primary production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

The oldest running sites have been recording data since over twenty years. Thanks to the international FLUXNET initiative, these time series data are made openly accessible from over hundred sites and provided in a standardized format and complemented with measurements of several meteorological variables, plus soil temperature and moisture, measured in parallel. These data provide an opportunity for understanding ecosystem fluxes and how they are affected by environmental covariates. The challenge is to build models that are sufficiently generalisable in space. That is, temporally resolved relationships learned from one subset of sites should be used effectively to predict time series, given environmental covariates, at new sites (spatial upscaling).\nThis is a challenge as previous research has shown that relatively powerful site-specific models can be trained, but predictions to new sites have been found wanting. This may be due to site-specific characteristics (e.g. vegetation type) that have thus far not been satisfactorily encoded in models. In other words, factors that would typically be regarded as random factors in mixed effects modelling, continue to undermine effective learning in machine learning models.\nApproach We found that deep neural networks that learn temporal dependencies in the data (Long-Short Term Memory, LSTM) are well-suited for this prediction task.\nPreliminary results Our results indicate that spatially generalisable LSTM models outperform our mechanistic model (the P-model) in predicting GPP.\nBenchmarking of the LSTM versus a “physical model” - the P-model.

As a consequence, the relative change in fluxes should be equal to the relative change in pool size. Such model formulations are also termed as “source-driven”. In contrast, “sink-driven” would imply that it’s not the (input) fluxes that determine the change in pool sizes, but other limiting factors that are independent of input fluxes. This has also been formulated as a fundamental critique in the way current DGVMs are conceived and thus, at least partly, predetermine their projected land C balance changes in climate change scenarios.\nThe question is: How close are models actually from being fully sink-driven? Or in other words: How linear is their dynamics?\nDGVMs have evolved over several generations, starting from C-only models with a big-leaf representation and average individuals in a stand, to models that represent a coupled C-nutrient cycling, and now to models that combine explicit representations of forest stand dynamics with biochemical cycling. All these modifications should increase the importance of feedbacks within the system that leads to deviations from a linear, strictly source-driven behavior.\nPreliminary results Relatinship of the relantive enhancement in NPP versus the relative enhancement in GPP, derived from CO2-only simulations of a set of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models.

(2021).\nGlobal maps of estimated rooting zone water storage capacity and rooting depth is available on Zenodo.\nLink my vEGU2020 presentation on this project here.\nSummary Rooting depth governs plants’ access to water during dry (rain-free) periods and is thus a key variable determining the sensitivity of transpiration and carbon assimilation to soil moisture drought and land-climate coupling during drought and heat events. Plant rooting depth variations of two orders of magnitude have been recorded across the globe and a substantial portion of this variation appears within species and functional groups. This suggests that plant rooting depth is a relatively plastic “trait” that may adjust to the local environment and soil hydrology and possibly also to temporally changing climatic conditions. Yet, plant rooting depth is commonly treated as a fixed parameter in global vegetation and climate models, specified for each plant functional type. How can respective trait flexibility be introduced in such models?\nApproaches to explain these large variations have focussed on the depth of the local water table as a constraint on the maximum rooting depth (Fan et al., 2017), on the mean seasonality and synchrony of precipitation and radiation (Gao et al., 2014; Schenk et al., 2005), or on optimality principles for balancing the trade-offs between the benefits of deep rooting and their associated costs (carbon used for root construction and respiration and maintaining water transport along the entire soil-root-leaf pathway) (Kleidon and Heimann, 1998; Schymanski et al., 2009).\nHere, we follow the approach by Gao et al. (2014), assuming that plants’ rooting depth is adjusted to sustain cumulative water deficits (precipitation minus evapotranspiration: P - ET) of a magnitude, corresponding to an event with a return period of N years, where N is a global constant. The water deficit is determined using daily reanalysis data of precipitation, while ET is estimated from remotely sensed vegetation cover and observed radiation, and from simulated stomatal responses to observed vapour pressure deficit across the globe for the past 35 years. Cumulative water deficits are translated into a “soil drying depth” using information on soil texture and its estimated water holding capacity.\nOur results reveal a global pattern of plant rooting depth, adjusted to the apparent cumulative water deficit during rain-free periods, peaking at intermediate aridity, where dry periods are long, radiation is high, and vegetation cover is substantial. A comparison to biome-level distributions of observed rooting depths indicates that the control by the cumulative water deficit, embodied in our model, is a powerful driver of variations between biomes. Shallowest rooting depths are observed and modelled in boreal forests and alpine meadows, while deepest rooting is observed and modelled in xeric forests. Stomatal response to dry conditions appears to be an important mechanism that mitigates the necessity for deep rooting, particularly in broadleaved tropical and temperate forests. Our analysis also revealed challenges in bridging the scales of observations and our global-scale model, possibly due to small-scale heterogeneity in soil water availability driven by the topographic setting.\n","date":1632563798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632563798,"objectID":"5ddefce89f6b90a9d63590d67e25afc8","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/project/rootingdepth/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T11:56:38+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/rootingdepth/","section":"project","summary":"A method for sensing the global distribution of the rooting zone water storage capacity from space.

Despite its importance to land-surface modeling, variations of S0 across space are largely unknown as they cannot be observed directly. We developed a method to diagnose global variations of S0 from the relationship between vegetation activity (measured by sun-induced fluorescence and by the evaporative fraction) and the cumulative water deficit (CWD). We then show that spatial variations in S0 can be predicted from the assumption that plants are adapted to sustain CWD extremes occurring with a return period that is related to the life form of dominant plants and the large-scale topographical setting. Predicted biome-level S0 distributions, translated to an apparent rooting depth (zr) by accounting for soil texture, are consistent with observations from a comprehensive zr dataset. Large spatial variations in S0 across the globe reflect adaptation of zr to the hydroclimate and topography and implies large heterogeneity in the sensitivity of vegetation activity to drought. The magnitude of S0 inferred for most of the Earthtextquoterights vegetated regions and particularly for those with a large seasonality in their hydroclimate indicates an important role for plant access to water stored at depth - beyond the soil layers commonly considered in land-surface models.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":[],"title":"Global distribution of the rooting zone water storage capacity reflects plant adaptation to the environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557556,"objectID":"023e0c4f22e61bca8f9f0f14fd5c134c","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/cwd/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:36.315508Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cwd/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"cwd v1.0: R package for cumulative water deficit  calculation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663417546,"objectID":"efc14761f9e3876fb90c7955997b91f0","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/dyptop/","publishdate":"2022-09-17T12:25:46.021943Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dyptop/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"DYPTOP v1.0: Demo code for dynamical global  peatland modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker","Koen Hufkens"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663417546,"objectID":"97948a56aeb71667d261c7487fd2a90a","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/ingestr/","publishdate":"2022-09-17T12:25:45.868745Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ingestr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ingestr v1.3: R package for environmental data  ingest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557556,"objectID":"5ed942350f7837029e49cdbae8cf3c9a","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/ml-4-ec-workshop/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:36.586774Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ml-4-ec-workshop/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ml4ec_workshop: v1: Initial version","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin D.

Here we create a database of root-mass fractions (RMFs), an index of plant below- versus aboveground biomass distributions, and generate quantitative, spatially explicit global maps of RMFs in trees, shrubs and grasses. Our analyses reveal large gradients in RMFs both across and within vegetation types that can be attributed to resource availability. High RMFs occur in cold and dry ecosystems, while low RMFs dominate in warm and wet regions. Across all vegetation types, the directional effect of temperature on RMFs depends on water availability, suggesting feedbacks between heat, water and nutrient supply. By integrating our RMF maps with existing aboveground plant biomass information, we estimate that in forests, shrublands and grasslands, respectively, 22%, 47% and 67% of plant biomass exists belowground, with a total global belowground fraction of 24% (20--28%), that is, 113 (90--135) Gt carbon.

Although plant biomass often increases in elevated CO2 (eCO2) experiments4--6, SOC has been observed to increase, remain unchanged or even decline7. The mechanisms that drive this variation across experiments remain poorly understood, creating uncertainty in climate projections8,9. Here we synthesized data from 108 eCO2 experiments and found that the effect of eCO2 on SOC stocks is best explained by a negative relationship with plant biomass: when plant biomass is strongly stimulated by eCO2, SOC storage declines; conversely, when biomass is weakly stimulated, SOC storage increases. This trade-off appears to be related to plant nutrient acquisition, in which plants increase their biomass by mining the soil for nutrients, which decreases SOC storage. We found that, overall, SOC stocks increase with eCO2 in grasslands (8 textpm 2 per cent) but not in forests (0 textpm 2 per cent), even though plant biomass in grasslands increase less (9 textpm 3 per cent) than in forests (23 textpm 2 per cent). Ecosystem models do not reproduce this trade-off, which implies that projections of SOC may need to be revised.","tags":[],"title":"A trade-off between plant and soil carbon storage under elevated CO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice Favero","Robert Mendelsohn","Brent Sohngen","Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557557,"objectID":"04a5adbb6152edd910623906934642ee","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/favero-21-erl/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:37.688226Z","relpermalink":"/publication/favero-21-erl/","section":"publication","summary":"This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and economic impacts of climate change on global and regional forests from now through 2200. By integrating the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios with climate models, a vegetation model, socio-economic scenarios, and a forest economic model, the study explores long run adjustments of both ecosystems and markets to climate change that have not been studied before. The ecological model suggests that global forest productivity increases under RCP 8.5. The overall supply of timber expands faster than demand through the 23rd century lowering timber prices and creating net benefits in the timber sector. Consumers benefit the most from the lower prices but these same low prices tend to damage forest owners, especially in the tropics. Even without a formal sequestration policy, average global forest carbon is projected to increase by 6%–8% by 2100. Under the RCP 2.6, forest carbon remains stable through 2200 but under RCP 8.5 it is simulated to increase by another 8% with a very heterogeneous distribution across world regions. Under both RCPs, global forest area is projected to increase relative to a no-climate change case until 2150, but possibly decline thereafter.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing the long-term interactions of climate change and timber markets on forest land and carbon storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandy P.

However, systematic errors and persistently large differences among carbon and water cycle projections by different models highlight the limitations of current process formulations. In this review, focusing on core plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying hypotheses derived from eco-evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide novel, parameter-sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of core, leaf-level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence. EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models. EEO approaches to other important traits, including the leaf economics spectrum and applications of EEO at the community level are active research areas. Independently tested modules emerging from EEO studies could profitably be integrated into modelling frameworks that account for the multiple time scales on which plants and plant communities adjust to environmental change.","tags":["\"acclimation\"","\"eco-evolutionary optimality\"","\"global vegetation model\"","\"land-surface model\"","\"leaf economics spectrum\"","\"plant functional ecology\"","\"stomatal behaviour\"","\"water and carbon trade-offs\""],"title":"Eco-evolutionary optimality as a means to improve vegetation and land-surface models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mana Gharun","Stefan Klesse","Gregory Tomlinson","Peter Waldner","Benjamin Stocker","Beat Rihm","Rolf Siegwolf","Nina Buchmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663417545,"objectID":"99926f40a02d8b674f8d153007784af6","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/gharun-21-erl/","publishdate":"2022-09-17T12:25:45.558496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gharun-21-erl/","section":"publication","summary":"The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis is accompanied by an inevitable loss of water vapor through the stomata of leaves. The rate of leaf-level CO2 assimilation per unit stomatal conductance, i.e., intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), is thus a key characteristic of terrestrial ecosystem functioning that is central to the global hydroclimate system. Empirical evidence and theory suggest a positive response of forest water-use efficiency to increased CO2 levels globally. Although evidence exists for a positive effect of ecosystem nitrogen (N) inputs on WUEi, it is not clear how trends in atmospheric N deposition have affected WUEi in the past. Here we combine twentieth-century climate and nitrogen deposition with stable isotope signature in tree rings and document a WUEi trend reversal at two sites in Switzerland, that matches the timing of a trend reversal in atmospheric N deposition. Using Generalized Additive Models, we fitted observed WUEi time series to multiple environmental covariates. This suggested N deposition to have a significant effect on long-term WUEi at the site that was exposed to higher N deposition levels. The ratio of the increase in WUEi in response to increase in CO2 (dWUEi/dCO2) declined by 96% after 1980 (from 0.53 to 0.02) in the beech forest and declined by 72% in the spruce forest (from 0.46 to 0.13) concurrent with a sharp decline in N deposition. Using the GAM model for two scenarios, we show that had N deposition levels not declined after 1980s, WUEi would have increased more strongly in response to increasing CO2. Although the increase in N deposition was limited to the 1950-1980 decades and the signals have declined with improvements in air quality across Europe, the role of atmospheric pollution must be reconsidered in interpretation of tree ring studies and for building environmental proxies that are pivotal to understanding future sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate change.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of nitrogen deposition on centennial forest water-use efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonie Schönbeck","Charlotte Grossiord","Arthur Gessler","Jonas Gisler","Katrin Meusburger","Petra D\\textquoterightOdorico","Andreas Rigling","Yann Salmon","Benjamin D.

In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.","tags":[],"title":"Organizing principles for vegetation dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"," jmaspons"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557559,"objectID":"bab3a5f3419beb6729673dad6bf567b8","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/rsofun/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:39.333042Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsofun/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"stineb/rsofun: LM3-PPA implemented","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Photosynthesis of the terrestrial biosphere drives the land carbon cycle. For example, year-to-year variations in terrestrial photosynthesis are the dominant cause for year-to-year changes in land carbon uptake and the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Understanding terrestrial photosynthesis is thus important for understanding the fate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and their effect on driving climate change.\nUnfortunately, terrestrial photosynthesis cannot be measured directly. Most available estimates are based on remote sensing observations of the vegetation cover, combined with models for the efficiency by which absorbed light is used for carbon assimilation. Recently, new methods have been developed to use alternative remotely sensed observations (e.g., sun-induced fluorescence) to estimate terrestrial photosynthesis. Also Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) provide estimates of terrestrial photosynthesis, but they don’t use remotely sensed observations directly.\nAbove: (left) spatial distribution of annual mean sun-induced fluorescence (SiF), a proxy for GPP; (right) spatial distribution of annual total GPP, mean across multiple remote sensing-based models. This illustrates the inconsisten spatial distribution (particularly the tropics-extratropics gradient) of remote sensing-based GPP estimates.\nResearch in our group has revealed that these approaches yield inconsistent estimates in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of photosynthesis rates and (ii) the magnitude of year-to-year variability. The challenge that you will address in this project is to find new constraints to resolve this inconsistency. The use of atmospheric CO2 measurements holds great promise as a constraint, but requires an estimate of the net carbon balance (including gains by photosynthesis and losses by respiration and disturbance). In this project, you will establish this link. You will develop a reduced-complexity representation of the terrestrial carbon balance, based on DGVM outputs and a pulse-response representation of terrestrial carbon storage. This will be used to “translate” remote-sensing based terrestrial photosynthesis estimates into implied effects on atmospheric CO2 and its spatial and year-by-year variations. Like this, we will be able to subject the contrasting remote sensing based estimates of terrestrial photosynthesis to a new test and find out which ones are more wrong than others.\nThis thesis is a great starting point for working with large datasets of the terrestrial biosphere and modelling. Experience with working with R, Python or other data science tools are an advantage. You may start as soon as you like.\n","date":1581410161,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581410161,"objectID":"7658aafd8d299686d50e117d9f63d347","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/project/terrphoto/","publishdate":"2020-02-11T09:36:01+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/terrphoto/","section":"project","summary":"Developing a reduced-complexity land carbon balance model to use atmospheric constraints on terrestrial photosynthesis.","tags":[],"title":"New constraints on terrestrial photosynthesis","type":"project"},{"authors":["S.

Satellites are collecting information about the state of the Earth surface in ever more fine-grained resolution. CO2 and water exchange fluxes between the vegetation and the atmosphere are continuously measured at several hundred sites across the globe. And (almost) all of this data is being made easily accessible to researchers from any institution or country. This data revolution has created a playground for data analysis and a testbed for models with an unprecedented potential for addressing scientific challenges and resolving pressing questions.\nHow do droughts affect photosynthesis, vegetation productivity and the global carbon cycle? is one such question. Remote-sensing based models are widely used for estimating terrestrial photosynthesis. These commonly use information about the greenness of the Earth surface, incoming solar radiation and some measure of dryness. Due to the limitation that soil moisture is particularly challenging to observe from satellites, these models have commonly resorted to using information only on the atmospheric dryness (vapour pressure deficit). In view of known physiological mechanisms by which plants respond to drying soils, the question is: Does vapour pressure deficit alone provide enough information to simulate drought impacts on vegetation? The advantage of our world’s data richness is that we now have more precise insights from observations to better uncover weaknesses in models. One such insight we gained in an earlier study (Stocker et al., 2018), where we isolated the soil moisture effect on photosynthesis from other drivers, including the (partly co-varying) vapour pressure deficit. By analysing patterns in the data from flux measurements and satellites, we found a clear additional effect by soil moisture that substantially reduces photosynthesis during “soil moisture droughts” - an effect that cannot be estimated when solely relying on information on vapour pressure deficit. It was an obvious question to ask whether the remote sensing-based terrestrial photosynthesis models, which do not account for soil moisture directly, can still accurately simulate photosynthesis during these, now well-defined drought periods. Freely accessible data and an open data sharing philosophy of the research community made it possible that within a short amount of time, we had all the necessary resources to start investigating. And soon thereafter, we had our Eureka moment: Indeed, all the models we investigated had a very clear relationship with the timing and magnitude of the apparent soil moisture stress we identified earlier. This is what we show in the paper, now published in Nature Geoscience (Stocker et al., 2019).\nThis finding has implications not only for simulating vegetation productivity, but also for estimating the impacts of extreme events and the year-to-year variations of the terrestrial carbon balance. Dry and hot periods like last year’s summer in northern Europe can negatively affect the C balance of a whole continent and thereby accelerate the man-made increase in atmospheric CO2. Our new paper shows that the size of such anomalies, and therefore the magnitude of disruption of the C cycle, is substantially underestimated when the additional effect by soil moisture stress is neglected. This clearly points to the need for revising satellite-based monitoring of vegetation productivity and to develop new methods for including information on how soil moisture varies across space and time and how this affects vegetation productivity. Our findings come at a time when several groups are developing new methods to use remotely sensed information to estimate soil moisture. Resolving this challenge is important as with a changing climate, periods of drought may become more frequent, intense and prolonged and we need to have a better grasp of how this affects ecosystems and the carbon cycle.\nReferences Stocker, B.

In other words, common satellite-based vegetation monitoring methods underestimate the impact of droughts.\nWhat are the implications of this bias for our understanding of the terrestrial C cycle and its year-to-year variability? We investigated this question using a new global implementation of the P-model (open-access code available here). Our results suggest that accurately capturing soil moisture stress in photosynthesis modelling is crucial for estimating the year-to-year variability in vegetation productivity and the impacts of drought extreme events. Not capturing this effect accurately leads to a substantial underestimation of this variability and to a systematic underestimation of drought extreme event impacts on vegetation productivity.\nHowever, in our simulations, the locally strong soil moisture effect on vegetation productivity and its variability does not translate into a similarly strong water-control on the global-scale variability in terrestrial gross primary productivity. This is due to the compensating effects of different continents that are not synchronously drought-stressed and tend to compensate each other.\nIn view of a recent study by Humphrey et al. (2018) who found a clear relationship between terrestrial water storage and the atmospheric CO2 growth rate, this raises a fundamental question about the evident water-carbon coupling at the global scale: Is it an apparent phenomenon where terrestrial water storage is a proxy for some other factor that controls vegetation functioning? Or are we missing some element of plant access to water that has a longer memory and stronger year-to-year variability, so that the simulated compensating effects from different continents that we found would no longer neatly compensate each other at the global scale? This is an exciting lead for future research…\nFurther links A blogpost written for Nature Ecology and Evolution - Behind the Paper.

Here we discuss how to integrate our understanding of past carbon cycle changes within constraints of the land carbon budget.\n(This article was published in the PAGES Magazine Special Issue on Past Land Use and Land Cover Change)\nParticular features in the ice-core CO2 and CH4 records have been hypothesized to be linked to the rise and fall of agriculture and societies (Ruddiman 2003) and have been used to serve as stratigraphic markers for the Anthropocene (Lewis and Maslin 2015). The trend reversals in atmospheric CO2 around 7000 yr BP and in CH4 around 5000 yr BP and their continuous increase thereafter have been linked to the expansion of early agriculture, associated deforestation and CO2 emissions, and the establishment of wet rice cultivation with high CH4 emissions. The apparent downturn in atmospheric CO2 after 1500 CE falls into the period following the arrival of Europeans in the Americas and the subsequent dramatic collapse of native populations. However, these proposed hypotheses, claiming a causal link between the history of civilizations and greenhouse gas changes, critically rest on the plausibility of land-use and land-cover change (LULC) reconstructions and the magnitude of associated greenhouse gas emissions.\nContrasting land use reconstructions\nLULC has reduced the land area covered by forest throughout much of the Holocene. Today, about a third of the Earth’s surface area is — more or less intensively — in use for agriculture. This estimate of modern land use is derived from national statistics and satellite data. However, such precise information is only available for the last few decades. Proxy records of past vegetation cover from pollen recorded in lake sediments or bogs have only just begun to be used for quantitative land cover reconstructions (Editorial, this issue). Instead, reconstructions of past LULC are typically based on estimates of historical population size and assumptions on the per-capita requirement of cropland and pasture area over the Holocene. These values are highly uncertain, and the most widely used land-use reconstructions provide conflicting results (see Harrison et al., this issue).\nReplacement of forests by agricultural land also affects the energy balance at the land surface, reduces evapotranspiration where trees have been replaced by crops and grasses, and increases evapotranspiration where lands are being irrigated. It further increases the surface albedo, especially in northern latitudes when snow is present. This effect has contributed to a cooling in the mid-latitudes that counteracted LULC-induced warming due to greenhouse-gas emissions, and may have exacerbated cold conditions during the Little Ice Age (Betts et al. 2007). Reducing the large uncertainties in reconstructions of past LULC is therefore important to define a reliable land surface forcing as a boundary condition for climate model simulations covering past centuries and millennia and for other earth system simulations that use preindustrial (commonly taken as year 1850) boundary conditions (see also Harrison et al., this issue).\nLand conversion also impacts carbon (C) storage in the soil. The long residence time of soil carbon entails legacy effects of past land use on the land carbon balance, even decades after land conversion. Conflicting land-use reconstructions underpin the ongoing debate about the extent and impact of preindustrial human activities on the carbon cycle and climate. However, there are two constraints that help narrow the range of possible land-use histories in the past (Stocker et al. 2017) and the influence of past LULC on climate and the carbon cycle.\nConstraints on LULC histories\nFirst, the present-day state of land use and the biomass density of vegetation across space is relatively well-known. The difference between C storage in actual vegetation and in potential natural vegetation is equal to cumulative CO2 emissions from past LULC since the first agriculturalists. Hence, cumulative LULC CO2 emissions are relatively well-constrained, which implies that uncertainty in past LULC emissions becomes mainly a problem of distributing their cumulative total through time. More emissions in distant millennia imply that less is left for the more recent past. Emissions have to converge to within the constrained range of estimates for cumulative emissions. Quantitatively, Stocker et al. (2017) found relatively small differences in cumulative LULC-induced CO2 emissions when applying different LULC histories in their model (Figure 1). However, further research is needed to reduce remaining uncertainty in cumulative emissions and differences between satellite and model-based estimates (Erb et al. 2018).\nThe second constraint comes from the total C budget of the terrestrial biosphere.

We work at the intersection of Earth system science, ecophysiology, ecology, applied statistics, and high-performance computing and use the widest possible diversity of observational data.\nA postdoc position to work with me on this project (see below ‘Postdoc: Scaling from trees to the forest’) is open now. A link to the ad and application is here.\nKey questions The functioning and structure of land ecosystems are fundamentally altered by a changing climate, increasing CO2, and altered in nutrient cycling. Yet, we are lacking robust predictions of impacts caused by expected global environmental change. This project addresses a set of key scientific challenges with the aim to develop novel predictive methods based on fundamental ecological principles, and to make use of the widest possible diversity of data streams to inform our predictions.\nWe are trying to answer three key questions:\nWill nutrients limit the land C uptake? What is the sensitivity of ecosystems to drought? How is tree growth and forest dynamics affected by changing resource limitations today? Allocation and resource limitations Our primary target is to better understand and model allocation, that is the distribution of carbon assimilated by photosynthesis into growth in different plant organs (foliage, wood, roots), reserves, or export into the soil rhizosphere. Changes in CO2, nutrient, and water availability cause shifts in allocation, which in turn has important repercussions on ecosystem carbon cycling and, if general patterns exist, affects the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere and feeds back to man-made climate change.\nWhat we can observe at the small scale (from experiments, forest inventories, flux measurements, etc.) determines what is happening at the global scale. By addressing allocation from all angles, and by systematically integrating models and observational data, MIND targets a better understanding of the controls on allocation and improves our predictive ability to simulate general patterns in allocation and its response to shifting in resource limitations and how this affects ecoystem dynamics and the terrestrial carbon balance.\nApproach We develop new modelling approaches for simulating vegetation functioning and structure, funded in optimality principles. Such principles predict, for example, how allocation and plant traits are governed by the environment under the premise that a given fitness criterion is optimised. Hence, optimality principles serve to simulate how key model parameters vary with the environment, rather than relying on fixed values for a pre-defined set of plant functional types - the common approach followed in first-generation vegetation models.\nFor code development, we work with a new modular vegetation modelling framework (SOFUN) and with the vegetation demography model LM3-PPA (collaboration with Dr. Ensheng Weng, NASA, USA).\nWe are devoted to an open science philosophy. For us, this means that we’ll make all code and other outputs…\nFindable by publishing on Zenodo and other premanent repositories, Openly accessible through github, and Reusable through free open-source software packages (see for example rpmodel) and comprehensive documentation (see for example SOFUN). The project This project will offer three fully funded positions:\nOne postdoc, 3 years, started 2020 Two PhD students, 4 years, started Summer 2020 … addressing three objectives:\nPhD 1: The nature of nutrient limitation Research will address three key questions:\nHow does optimal allocation affect C and N cycling? How does soil fertility influence the carbon cycle? What controls the rates of N fixation and loss? We will use the Global Change Manipulation Experiments database (under development, collaboration with Dr. Sara Vicca, PLECO, University of Antwerp) and explore the observational constraints on alternative model formulations for simulating coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics in terrestrial ecoystems.

The trade-off between photosynthesis and transpiration through stomata, the water-use efficiency (WUE), is an important driver of plant evolution and ecosystem functioning, and has profound effects on climate. Using stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in tree rings, we found that WUE has increased by a magnitude consistent with estimates from atmospheric measurements and model predictions. Enhanced photosynthesis was widespread, while reductions in stomatal conductance were modest and restricted to moisture-limited forests. This result points to smaller reductions in transpiration in response to increasing atmospheric CO2, with important implications for forest–climate interactions, which remain to be explored.Multiple lines of evidence suggest that plant water-use efficiency (WUE)—the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss—has increased in recent decades. Although rising atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as the principal cause, the underlying physiological mechanisms are still being debated, and implications for the global water cycle remain uncertain. Here, we addressed this gap using 30-y tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements and basal area increment from 12 species in 8 North American mature temperate forests. Our goal was to separate the contributions of enhanced photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance to WUE trends and to assess consistency between multiple commonly used methods for estimating WUE. Our results show that tree ring-derived estimates of increases in WUE are consistent with estimates from atmospheric measurements and predictions based on an optimal balancing of carbon gains and water costs, but are lower than those based on ecosystem-scale flux observations. Although both physiological mechanisms contributed to rising WUE, enhanced photosynthesis was widespread, while reductions in stomatal conductance were modest and restricted to species that experienced moisture limitations. This finding challenges the hypothesis that rising WUE in forests is primarily the result of widespread, CO2-induced reductions in stomatal conductance.","tags":[],"title":"Disentangling the role of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance on rising forest water-use efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin D.

Methods for estimating photosynthesis from space commonly combine information on vegetation greenness, incoming radiation, temperature and atmospheric demand for water (vapour-pressure deficit), but do not account for the direct effects of low soil moisture. They instead rely on vapour-pressure deficit as a proxy for dryness, despite widespread evidence that soil moisture deficits have a direct impact on vegetation, independent of vapour-pressure deficit. Here, we use a globally distributed measurement network to assess the effect of soil moisture on photosynthesis, and identify a common bias in an ensemble of satellite-based estimates of photosynthesis that is governed by the magnitude of soil moisture effects on photosynthetic light-use efficiency. We develop methods to account for the influence of soil moisture and estimate that soil moisture effects reduce global annual photosynthesis by ~15%, increase interannual variability by more than 100% across 25% of the global vegetated land surface, and amplify the impacts of extreme events on primary production. These results demonstrate the importance of soil moisture effects for monitoring carbon-cycle variability and drought impacts on vegetation productivity from space.","tags":[],"title":"Drought impacts on terrestrial primary production underestimated by satellite monitoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin D Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557559,"objectID":"1440d58a0c08e6d8e038ee304cc01062","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/pmodel-output-fluxnet-2015-stocker-19-gmd/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:39.728052Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pmodel-output-fluxnet-2015-stocker-19-gmd/","section":"publication","summary":"Gross primary production, simulated by the P-model for each FLUXNET 2015 Tier 1 site.

Terrestrial productivity, however, has many facets (e.g., spatial and temporal variability, including seasonality, interannual variability, and trends), and different vegetation indices may not be equally good at predicting them. Their accuracy in monitoring productivity has been mostly tested in single-ecosystem studies, but their performance in different ecosystems distributed over large areas still needs to be fully explored. To fill this gap, we identified the facets of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) that could be monitored using RSVIs. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, and CCI), derived from the MODIS MAIAC data set and of GPP derived from data from 58 eddy-flux towers in eight ecosystems with different plant functional types (evergreen needle-leaved forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, open shrubland, grassland, cropland, and wetland) distributed throughout Europe, covering Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal regions. The RSVIs monitored temporal variability well in most of the ecosystem types, with grasslands and evergreen broad-leaved forests most strongly and weakly correlated with weekly and monthly RSVI data, respectively. The performance of the RSVIs monitoring temporal variability decreased sharply, however, when the seasonal component of the time series was removed, suggesting that the seasonal cycles of both the GPP and RSVI time series were the dominant drivers of their relationships. Removing winter values from the analyses did not affect the results. NDVI and CCI identified the spatial variability of average annual GPP, and all RSVIs identified GPP seasonality well. The RSVI estimates, however, could not estimate the interannual variability of GPP across sites or monitor the trends of GPP. Overall, our results indicate that RSVIs are suitable to track different facets of GPP variability at the local scale, therefore they are reliable sources of GPP monitoring at larger geographical scales.","tags":[],"title":"Monitoring Spatial and Temporal Variabilities of Gross Primary Production Using MAIAC MODIS Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Here we use in situ leaf unfolding observations for eight deciduous tree species to show that the two factors that control chilling (number of cold days) and heat requirement (growing degree days at leaf unfolding, GDDreq) only explain 30% of the spatial variance of leaf unfolding. Radiation and aridity differences among sites together explain 10% of the spatial variance of leaf unfolding date, and 40% of the variation in GDDreq. Radiation intensity is positively correlated with GDDreq and aridity is negatively correlated with GDDreq spatial variance. These results suggest that leaf unfolding of temperate deciduous trees is adapted to local mean climate, including water and light availability, through altered sensitivity to spring temperature. Such adaptation of heat requirement to background climate would imply that models using constant temperature response are inherently inaccurate at local scale.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial variance of spring phenology in temperate deciduous forests is constrained by background climatic conditions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A complete and up-to-date overview of our open source products is on GitHub here.\nAs a group, we are committed to an Open Science Practice.

However, soil moisture limitation is known to strongly affect plant physiology. Here, we investigate light use efficiency, the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to absorbed light. We derive its fractional reduction due to soil moisture (fLUE), separated from VPD and greenness changes, using artificial neural networks trained on eddy covariance data, multiple soil moisture datasets and remotely sensed greenness. This reveals substantial impacts of soil moisture alone that reduce GPP by up to 40% at sites located in sub‐humid, semi‐arid or arid regions. For sites in relatively moist climates, we find, paradoxically, a muted fLUE response to drying soil, but reduced fLUE under wet conditions. fLUE identifies substantial drought impacts that are not captured when relying solely on VPD and greenness changes and, when seasonally recurring, are missed by traditional, anomaly‐based drought indices. Counter to common assumptions, fLUE reductions are largest in drought‐deciduous vegetation, including grasslands. Our results highlight the necessity to account for soil moisture limitation in terrestrial primary productivity data products, especially for drought‐related assessments.","tags":["\"drought impacts\"","\"eddy covariance\"","\"gross primary productivity (GPP)\"","\"light use efficiency\"","\"photosynthesis\"","\"soil moisture\"","\"standardized precipitation index\"","\"vapour pressure deficit (VPD)\""],"title":"Quantifying soil moisture impacts on light use efficiency across biomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sara Vicca","Benjamin Stocker","Sasha Reed","William R Wieder","Michael Bahn","Philip Fay","Ivan Janssens","Hans Lambers","Josep Peñuelas","Shilong Piao","Karin Rebel","Jordi Sardans","Bjarni Sigurdsson","Kevin Van Sundert","Ying-Ping Wang","Sonke Zaehle","Philippe Ciais"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632557566,"objectID":"7d247e1f3b83d395da88ddf1bbe6ab7a","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/publication/vicca-18-erl/","publishdate":"2021-09-25T08:12:46.052893Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vicca-18-erl/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract A wide range of research shows that nutrient availability strongly influences terrestrial carbon (C) cycling and shapes ecosystem responses to environmental changes and hence terrestrial feedbacks to climate. Nonetheless, our understanding of nutrient controls remains far from complete and poorly quantified, at least partly due to a lack of informative, comparable, and accessible datasets at regional-to-global scales. A growing research infrastructure of multi-site networks are providing valuable data on C fluxes and stocks and are monitoring their responses to global environmental change and measuring responses to experimental treatments. These networks thus provide an opportunity for improving our understanding of C-nutrient cycle interactions and our ability to model them. However, coherent information on how nutrient cycling interacts with observed C cycle patterns is still generally lacking. Here, we argue that complementing available C-cycle measurements from monitoring and experimental sites with data characterizing nutrient availability will greatly enhance their power and will improve our capacity to forecast future trajectories of terrestrial C cycling and climate. Therefore, we propose a set of complementary measurements that are relatively easy to conduct routinely at any site or experiment and that, in combination with C cycle observations, can provide a robust characterization of the effects of nutrient availability across sites. In addition, we discuss the power of different observable variables for informing the formulation of models and constraining their predictions. Most widely available measurements of nutrient availability often do not align well with current modelling needs. This highlights the importance to foster the interaction between the empirical and modelling communities for setting future research priorities.","tags":[],"title":"Using research networks to create the comprehensive datasets needed to assess nutrient availability as a key determinant of terrestrial carbon cycling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"In this blog, I’m going to argue why it is crucial to use observational data from ecosystem manipulation experiments (EME) for model evaluation and calibration. And I’m going to make this case using the example of nitrogen limitation and how EMEs guided the development of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) over the last one-and-a-half decades and repeatedly exposed their deficiencies. This, I hope, will convince you that there is a great future in a close relationship between modellers and experimentalists around the data from EMEs.\nFirst, a brief clarification about the relationship between models, in particular DGVMs, and data. DGVMs are process-based representations of ecosystem functioning and provide a bottom-up description of vegetation and biogeochemical cycles by explicitly simulating stand-level processes such as photosynthesis, growth, carbon allocation, mortality, fire, etc. This type of model contrasts statistical models, for example species distribution models, where statistical relationships, determined from data, are used to relate environmental variables to the model’s state variables of interest. In DGVMs, explicit processes are described by equations and parameters that can be directly measured. The simulated interplay of these processes finally governs higher-levels variables, such as NPP (see Fig. 1). Therefore, just to clarify, DGVMs don’t directly “use” data. Instead, data can be used indirectly to constrain or calibrate the parameters in DGVMs.\nThe relationship of models and data in DGVMs and statistical models.\nNow, why is the data from manipulation experiments so particularly interesting?\nFrom looking at a range of observational benchmarking datasets, one may conclude that DGVMs are a good representation of the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere. They do a fairly good job at capturing the current state and reliably simulate the global distributions of biomes, biomass, soil C stocks, and GPP. One may also look at the seasonality of C uptake and release fluxes: (One of the success stories of DGVMs is that they simulate the “breathing of the biosphere”) and even at the mean of the net terrestrial C balance and conclude that these models up to the job (Le Quere et al., 2016). And they have been up to that job since more than a decade.\nFig. 2 Terrestrial C balance from the global carbon budget (black) and a set of DGVMs (figure from Le Quere et al., 2016).\nBack then, about a decade ago, the first generation of DGVMs predicted that the land biosphere will act as a large and persistent C sink under continuously rising CO2 (Cramer et al., 2001; Friedlingstein et al., 2006). This prediction made it into the IPCC AR4 (Prentice et al., 2007) and these types of vegetation models were adopted as components in coupled Earth System Models that are used for climate projections still today. But at around the same time appeared the first results from long-term ecosystem manipulation experiments. Their results suggested that this sustained land C sink is no longer supported by insights from Free-Air-CO2-Enrichment (FACE) experiments and multiple studies found that N is the dominant factor limiting plant growth (Schneider et al., 2004; Norby et al., 2010; Reich \u0026amp; Hobbie, 2012). None of the DGVMs yet accounted for such limiting effects. Therefore, speculations were made about the mechanisms that would lead to such an outcome that develops over several years. The Progressive Nitrogen Limitation (PNL) hypothesis was proposed (Luo et al., 2004) which suggests that upon a (e.g. CO2-induced) stimulation of growth, N gets locked up in live biomass and depleted in the soil. This would lead to an increase in the tissue C:N ratio which, when added to litter, would further reduce soil net N mineralisation and N availability. The initial growth stimulation would progressively disappear. However, observational evidence for the PNL was not clear and an alternative hypothesis, stating that increased belowground C inputs would stimulate N mineralisation, could not be excluded either (Reich \u0026amp; Hobbie, 2012). A key point I want to make here is that evidence for such mechanisms coming from the a few experiments is to some degree anecdotal and we’re sometimes faced with counterintuitive results that fit none of the popular hypotheses (see e.g. Feng et al., 2015). Our understanding of the systems’ functioning has to be coded up in the form of a quantitative, process-based model. Only this gives us predictive capabilities.\nAnyway, what stuck regarding N limitation was the Perspectives paper by Hungate et al. (2013) in Science where they argued that the C sequestration simulated by C-only DGVMs implies that an amount of N would become available that was far beyond their estimate.\nThis set the target for the modelling community: “We need a N cycle”. And what should it do? Limit something. For example GPP (see CLM model) or NPP (see most other models). Liebig’s Law of the Minimum sounds like a reasonable approach …","date":1507292250,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507292250,"objectID":"e330ae1c7795e8ef000a3ee37405b4f1","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/post/cn_experiments/","publishdate":"2017-10-06T13:17:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cn_experiments/","section":"post","summary":"In this blog, I’m going to argue why it is crucial to use observational data from ecosystem manipulation experiments (EME) for model evaluation and calibration.

The top-down models estimated NBP net carbon sinks were 20 $±$ 170, 4 $±$ 90 and 24 $±$ 180 TgC yr −1 . In comparison, regional emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels were 495, 275, and 770 TgC yr −1 , which are many times higher than the NBP sink estimates, suggesting that the contribution of the fossil fuel emissions to the carbon budget of SSEA results in a significant net carbon source during the 2000s. When considering both NBP and fossil fuel emissions for the individual countries within the regions, Bhutan and Laos were net carbon sinks and rest of the countries were net carbon source during the 2000s. The relative contributions of each of the fluxes (NBP, NEP, E LUC , and E FIRE , fossil fuel emissions) to a nation's net carbon flux varied greatly from country to country, suggesting a heterogeneous dominant carbon fluxes on the country-level throughout SSEA.","tags":[],"title":"The terrestrial carbon budget of South and Southeast Asia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Stocker"],"categories":[],"content":"A general notion of “soil fertility” is commonly left unaccounted for in models of the terrestrial biosphere and has received relatively little attention in carbon cycle science. This changed since the presentation of results by Vicca et al. (2012) and Fernandez-Martinez et al. (2014).\nUsing data from forests around the globe where gross primary productivity (GPP) has been measured in parallel to changes in ecosystem biomass storage, these authors showed that forests produce biomass more efficiently on fertile soils. This efficiency can be quantified as the ratio of biomass production (BP) to GPP. Two factors affect this ratio. First, autotrophic respiration (Ra) – the C cost of maintaining cellular function (maintenance respiration) and synthesising new tissue (growth respiration). This factor has been shown previously to cause relatively large variations in CUE (= NPP/GPP = (GPP-Ra)/GPP) due to effects of forest stand age, climate, and forest type. However, Ra doesn’t appear to vary with soil fertility (Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2014). The second factor that determines the ratio of BP:GPP is the amount of C exported to the soil (Cex). There is also a third factor, the production of volatile organic compounds, VOCs, that has been shown to significantly affect the plant’s C budget, especially under heat stress. Let’s ignore this for now. Traditionally, Cex hasn’t commonly been separated out from NPP, and is often left unquantified in field studies. However, more recent research has shown that up to around 20% of NPP may be consumed by Cex.\nWe can now write:\nnew: BP = GPP – Ra – Cex – VOC\nold: NPP = GPP – Ra\nIn parallel to the observed variations on BP:GPP by Vicca et al. (2012) and Fernandez-Martinez et al. (2014), they also found that the ratio of fine root to total biomass was almost three times higher in nutrient poor than in nutrient rich forest, and that the LAI per unit fine-root biomass is twice as large in nutrient rich forests. This is perfectly in line with earlier studies reporting general and strong variations of these allocation patterns along soil fertility gradients (Poorter et al., 2012). Apparently, on low-fertility soils, plants invest more C below-ground. C allocation thus dynamically adjusts in response to soil fertility – a mechanism ignored by today’s generation of global vegetation and terrestrial carbon cycle models altogether.\nBut where does Cex go and what is its function? Clearly, growing more roots serves a better soil exploration in the search for nutrients required for plant growth (apart from accessing soil moisture and maybe even ground water). In contrast, the exuded C (Cex) may be consumed by an array of soil organisms with the pleasant effect of improving nutrient availability for the plant – either directly (N2-fixing bacteria in root nodules; mycorrhizal fungi living on the root tips) or indirectly (free-living N2-fixing bacteria in the soil; other heterotrophs that accelerate soil turnover and N mineralization, so called priming). The importance of these effects are only now becoming to be fully appreciated and integrated into models of the terrestrial C budget, and a quantitative and mechanistic link to soil fertility is yet to be established – the goal of my work here in the group of Colin Prentice.\nThe lesson from all this (relatively new) research described above is that the nutrient availability appears to be under clear biological control, but that their acquisition comes at a cost to the plant: C used below-ground (root production and Cex) is missing for above-ground growth and the competition for light. We can say that this cost is dependent on the soil fertility and implies that there must be a soil fertility-dependent balance of above- versus below-ground allocation that is optimal for the plant with respect to maximizing its “fitness”. Such considerations are the target of theoretical studies that bear great potential in providing quantitative predictions of C allocation (Mäkelä et al., 2008; Franklin et al., 2014).\nNow two more points that need clarification: 1. What is soil fertility? and 2. How does the concept of soil fertility relate to the classical view of nutrient limitation?\nSoil fertility is often indirectly defined by “where plants grow well”. This may also be expressed as “where nutrients are easily available” a condition affected by the soil chemistry and structure in ways that are difficult to describe and predict mechanistically, especially at a global scale. However, there is a set of parameters often measured, directly or indirectly, in the field that appear to determine “soil fertility”. These include pH, the cation exchange capacity, available N and P, C:N ratio of soil organic matter, C content, and the texture (fractions of sand, clay, loam, silt). The soil type itself is something like a “syndrome” expressed by typical values of these measurable parameters, but may also provide readily accessible information.

Natural, that is non-human affected, N inputs are small and have been shown not to be sufficient to explain the measured N balance. Biological N fixation (BNF) must account for the remainder. However, drawing a complete picture of the N budget in terrestrial ecosystems has been notoriously difficult, because BNF is practically impossible to measure and estimated rates of global BNF range from around 200 TgN (Cleveland et al., 1999) to 58 TgN (Vitousek et al., 2013). Today, research is stuck.\nThis lack of understanding of the amount, but also of the controls on BNF introduces a “wildcard” for carbon (C) cycle projections under future climate change. Early C-only vegetation models suggested massive C sequestration under rising atmospheric CO2. However, for every C fixed into organic compounds, a relatively tightly constrained amount of N is required. But where does this N come from? Hungate et al. (2003) argued that these C-only model’s predictions were unrealistic because the implied additional N required for C sequestration would have to be provided by additional BNF, and that the required amounts of additional BNF were not “realistic”. But what is realistic?\nMore recently, vegetation models have been developed with the aim of introducing more “realism”. One such aspect is the coupling of C and N cycles. Indeed, this new generation of models generally does suggest less C sequestration, mostly for reasons of progressive N limitation (PNL) (Luo et al., 2004), meaning that additional N fixed in organic compounds leads to a depletion of N availability in soils because ecosystems can’t bring in enough N and thus run into a PNL. Is this realistic?\nEcosystem manipulation experiments and observations along gradients of varying N availability draw a different picture. The C allocation of plants appears to be flexible and responding to the availability of nutrients in the soil. Symbiotic associations between plants and mycorrhiza (root fungi) and N-fixing bacteria are away for plants to overcome nutrient shortage. However, these come at a cost of feeding C to symbionts. Also the “blind” exudation of labile C by plants into the soil stimulates microbial soil decomposition and N mineralisation and thus improves N availability. Apparently, getting enough N is not impossible but is also not free.\nN cycling in land ecosystems. Reference state.\nN cycling in land ecosystems. N-limited state.\nHence, a way of advancing the mechanistic understanding of the controls on N fixation could be by looking at the ecosystem energy economy – that is the C economy. N fixation is a particularly costly option to acquire N. Feeding the nitrogenase enzyme to break up the sturdy N2 bond is expensive. Modeling these trade-offs is one of the big goals of my work here at Colin Prentice’s lab.\nWhat observations can be used to test such modeling approaches? Free Air CO2Enrichment (FACE) experiments have generated plenty of data to gain a better insight into C allocation changes under rising CO2. And indeed, more N appears to get bound into plant biomass when photosynthesis increases. However, knowing where this additional N is coming from remains unresolved. Either, it’s provided by accelerated soil organic matter decomposition, stimulated by more below-ground plant C allocation, or it’s brought in from the atmosphere via BNF.\nIf the first option is the case, then what happens to soil organic matter (SOM) stocks under continuing CO2 increase in the decades and centuries to come? A way to gain a better understanding of ecosystem responses to large-scale environmental change is to look into the past. The shift from the last ice age to the present warm period provides an analogue for future climate change (although from a different background and at a much slower pace). Again, if no additional N was brought into ecosystems back then, SOM stocks would have had to be tapped. Did they decrease indeed? Also, if no additional N was brought in, then ecosystems would indeed have run into a progressive N limitation. This would also imply that inorganic N stocks were depleted and lead to much less gaseous N losses and hence N2O emissions. Is this the case?\nSpahni et al. (in prep.) now show that terrestrial N2O emissions did indeed increase as CO2went up after the last ice age. This may be interpreted as a strong indication that no such PNL occurred. Hence, BNF must have increased along with the demand for N as ecosystems sequestered more C.\nThe bottom line is that measurements of BNF are notoriously difficult but there are other, indirect constraints on how ecosystems respond to changes in N availability. Apart from manipulation experiments, analyses along environmental gradients, and evidence from palaeo-information, also the isotopic composition of 15N/14N may be used to estimate …","date":1421498104,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1421498104,"objectID":"97247b3f3937af09440e5b56ba181f2d","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/post/nquestion/","publishdate":"2015-01-17T13:35:04+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/nquestion/","section":"post","summary":"To address this question, we have to start with the notion that, on the long term, N losses from ecosystems via gaseous and leaching pathways have to be compensated by N inputs.","tags":[],"title":"The Big N Question: What controls rates of nitrogen fixation and losses?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Helal Ahammad","Harry Clark","Hongmin Dong","Elnour A.

But recent work has suggested that observed Northern Hemisphere midlatitude (NHML) land mean precipitation does not show evidence of an expected negative response to mid-twentieth-century aerosol forcing. Utilizing observed river discharges, the observed runoff is calculated and compared with observed land precipitation. The results show a near-zero twentieth-century trend in observed NHML land mean runoff, in contrast to the significant positive trend in observed NHML land mean precipitation. However, precipitation and runoff share common interannual and decadal variability. An obvious split, or breakpoint, is found in the NHML land mean runoff?precipitation relationship in the 1930s. Using runoff simulated by six land surface models (LSMs), which are driven by the observed precipitation dataset, such breakpoints are absent. These findings support previous hypotheses that inhomogeneities exist in the early-twentieth-century NHML land mean precipitation record. Adjusting the observed precipitation record according to the observed runoff record largely accounts for the departure of the observed precipitation response from that predicted given the real-world aerosol forcing estimate, more than halving the discrepancy from about 6 to around 2 W m?2. Consideration of complementary observed runoff adds support to the suggestion that NHML-wide early-twentieth-century precipitation observations are unsuitable for climate change studies. The agreement between precipitation and runoff over Europe, however, is excellent, supporting the use of whole-twentieth-century observed precipitation datasets here.","tags":[],"title":"Reconciling Precipitation with Runoff: Observed Hydrological Change in the Midlatitudes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The model results suggest that early agricultural activities cannot explain the mid to late Holocene CO(2) rise of 20 ppm measured on ice cores and that proposed upward revisions of Holocene ALCC imply a smaller contemporary terrestrial carbon sink. A set of illustrative scenarios is applied to test the robustness of these conclusions and to address the large discrepancies between published ALCC reconstructions. Simulated changes in atmospheric CO(2) due to ALCC are less than 1 ppm before 1000AD and 30 ppm at 2004AD when the HYDE3.1 ALCC reconstruction is prescribed for the past 12 000 years. Cumulative emissions of 69 GtC at 1850 and 233 GtC at 2004AD are comparable to earlier estimates. CO(2) changes due to ALCC exceed the simulated natural interannual variability only after 1000 AD. To consider evidence that land area used per person was higher before than during early industrialisation, agricultural areas from HYDE3.1 were increased by a factor of two prior to 1700AD (scenario H2). For the H2 scenario, the contemporary terrestrial carbon sink required to close the atmospheric CO(2) budget is reduced by 0.5 GtC yr(-1). Simulated CO(2) remains small even in scenarios where average land use per person is increased beyond the range of published estimates. Even extreme assumptions for preindustrial land conversion and high per- capita land use do not result in simulated CO(2) emissions that are sufficient to explain the magnitude and the timing of the late Holocene CO(2) increase.","tags":[],"title":"Sensitivity of Holocene atmospheric CO$_2$ and the modern carbon budget to early human land use: analyses with a process-based model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David C.

In our research, we use large volumes of Earth Observation and ecosystem data and machine learning methods to (i) infer information about the properties of the Critical Zone in controlling land-atmosphere exchange and land-climate feedbacks with a particular focus on the sensitivity of vegetation to water stress, (ii) forecast impacts of extreme heat and drought events on forests and pastures. With our data-driven research, we provide information of climate impacts at scales that are relevant to diverse stakeholders, and inform open questions underpinning bias and divergence in global models.\nDeveloping mechanistic models for robust simulations of terrestrial biosphere processes and their reposes to a changing environment. Our development of mechanistic ecosystem and terrestrial carbon cycle models is focused (i) on the implementation of eco-evolutionary optimality principles for simulating acclimating and adapting vegetation responses to environmental change; (ii) on resolving heterogeneity of vegetation structure (age and height) and the landscape (topography and hydrology) for continental-to-global scale model simulations; and (iii) integrating diverse ecosystem and Earth observation data for model calibration and predictions. Particular research challenges we currently address include effects of climate change and rising CO2 on plant growth, stoichiometry and carbon allocation, and on forest structure and stand dynamics; and the impacts of droughts across heterogenous landscapes and vegetation types. With this research, we contribute to building a next generation of terrestrial biosphere models for simulating climate change effects and Earth system dynamics across a range of time scales (from the past to the future).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://geco-group.org/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"Research in the GECO group takes place at the intersection of Earth system science, terrestrial ecology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, and data science and is carried out along the following lines:\nDeveloping data-driven methods to detect and predict impacts of climate extremes and patterns of vegetation-atmosphere exchange of water and CO2.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"}]
