      <title>Expanding a data cube workflow for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/post/minicuber/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With large collections of Earth Observation (EO) data becoming increasingly available, new possibilities to better understand and quantify environmental changes also arise. The acquisition, management, distribution, and analysis of such data is not trivial and can take up the majority of the time in modelling projects. This calls for frameworks and standardised pipelines for large EO datasets. In response to some of these challenges, multiple initiatives [1,2,3] propose data cubes (or minicubes) as a structured EO data catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data cube refers to a multi-dimensional data structure, which naturally arises with EO data where there are both the spatial and temporal components. Ideally, multiple heterogenous data sources can be combined in a minicube. Discrepancies in spatial resolutions are dealt with by regridding and resampling the various products to a common grid. Temporal aggregations can also be performed to match different timeseries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expanding-earthnets-minicuber&#34;&gt;Expanding Earthnet&amp;rsquo;s minicuber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthnet-minicuber python package [3] offers the possibility to obtain data cubes for satellite imagery and some other EO sources, but is primarily tailored towards Sentinel-2 imagery. In an effort to push forward data cubes for environmental and climate impact modelling, we extend the code such as to allow better integration of ERA5 climate reanalysis data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additions to the code now allow a better combination of Sentinel-2 and ERA5 data in the minicubes. It is possible to download ERA5 hourly variables via Amazon Web Servives, and automatically match the temporal frequency of Sentinel-2 which is 5-daily. The type of aggregation can be defined for each variable depening on the userâ€™s preference and the use-case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the updated minicuber code here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With minicubes available, the creation of pixel-level datasets ready for machine learning applications is the natural next step. Code has also been developed to generate these datasets after downloading minicubes.  In particular, one can integrate custom geospatial data to the minicube after having retrieved EO data online (for example, specific raster layers). We also offer a possibility to deal with cloud removal in the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Finally, context-target pairs of desired lengths can be extracted from the minicubes and are stored as compressed numpy arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Postdoc in drone-based vegetation water stress monitoring</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/postdoc_uav/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 08:46:40 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/postdoc_uav/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our group for Geocomputation and Earth Observation develops new model and data integration methods to gain a mechanistic understanding of the terrestrial biosphere. We are hosted at the Geography Institute of the University of Bern and work at the intersection of Earth system science, remote sensing, ecology, and hydrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position serves to establish and consolidate near-range remote sensing capacities in our research group and integrate field-based research within the context of our research on drought impact monitoring and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will plan and perform a drone-based surface reflectance remote sensing campaign for water stress detection in Swiss forests. You will analyse data and lead publications on vegetation water stress relations across landscape-scale gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate must hold a Ph.D. degree in a relevant field. Experience in drone-based remote sensing with completed training in the operation of UAVs, ideally with license, experience in managing field campaigns, and experience with close-range remote sensing data post-processing are required. The candidate should demonstrate proficient English written and oral skills. We expect a collaborative mentality and enthusiasm for the development of our computational infrastructure and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-offer&#34;&gt;We offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer the candidate to be part of a growing group with a strong collaborative philosophy and and a tight international network of leading partners, providing further career development opportunities toward future academic or industry positions. You will benefit from a supporting academic environment and from the attractive quality of life in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your online application including the following documents: Motivation letter (max. 2 pages, with a statement of research interests and demonstrated experience with software development projects), a CV, copies of academic qualifications and the names and e-mail addresses of three referees. Please note that we exclusively accept applications submitted through our online application portal. Applications via email or postal services will not be considered. We continue recruitment until a suitable candidate is found. The start of this position is at your earliest convenience. The position is offered for one year with possibility for continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
