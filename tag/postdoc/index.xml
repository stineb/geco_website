      <description>&lt;p&gt;The University of Bern is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher for a two-year position in Earth System Modeling with a focus on land vegetation dynamics, jointly hosted by the Climate and Environmental Physics division at the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Geography and affiliated with the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exciting opportunity focuses on the coupling and development of the Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity Bern3D and the Dynamic Global Vegetation Model LPX-Bern. The successful candidate will play a crucial role in advancing the models and our understanding of Earth system processes and their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve integration between Bern3D and LPX-Bern models to simulate fully coupled feedbacks between land, atmosphere, ocean, and ice sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantify and identify feedbacks and tipping points in the climate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate model results against paleoclimate data and perform simulations of future climate scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribute to ongoing international collaborations, including the Tipping Point Model Intercomparison project (TIPMIP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produce high-quality scientific publications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will actively contribute to the new groups on Global Biogeochemical Modeling (Dr. Frerk Pöppelmeier) and Geocomputation and Earth Observation (Prof. Benjamin Stocker), presenting results at international scientific conferences and publishing in the peer-reviewed literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate holds a PhD degree in Climate or Earth Science, Physics, or a related field, or will have obtained the degree before the start of the project. The candidate should have a deep interest in climate modeling and possess advanced programming skills (e.g., in Python, Fortran, R, Julia) and data handling skills. Additionally, the candidate should have a passion for interdisciplinary and collaborative research and be proficient in both written and spoken English. Knowledge of dynamical vegetation modeling is an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-offer&#34;&gt;We offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project offers the opportunity to work with experts in past and future climate modeling, proxy reconstructions, and land vegetation dynamics, providing an inspiring environment for Early Career Scientists in this field. The candidate will be part of a network of climate scientists across institutes and departments within the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The envisaged starting date is 1st March 2025 or upon agreement. Employment conditions and remuneration are in accordance with the standards of the University of Bern, Switzerland. The initial appointment is for two years, with the potential for extension.
For further information please contact Dr. Frerk Pöppelmeier (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:frerk.poeppelmeier@unibe.ch&#34;&gt;frerk.poeppelmeier@unibe.ch&lt;/a&gt;) and/or Prof. Benjamin Stocker (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:benjamin.stocker@unibe.ch&#34;&gt;benjamin.stocker@unibe.ch&lt;/a&gt;).
All applications received before 14th January 2025 will be reviewed, and further applications will be considered until the position is filled. Please send your application documents in a single PDF-file including a motivation letter, CV, degree certificates, and contact information for two references by e-mail to Dr. Frerk Pöppelmeier (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:frerk.poeppelmeier@unibe.ch&#34;&gt;frerk.poeppelmeier@unibe.ch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Postdoc in drone-based vegetation water stress monitoring</title>
      <link>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/postdoc_uav/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 08:46:40 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://geco-group.org/joinus_old/postdoc_uav/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our group for Geocomputation and Earth Observation develops new model and data integration methods to gain a mechanistic understanding of the terrestrial biosphere. We are hosted at the Geography Institute of the University of Bern and work at the intersection of Earth system science, remote sensing, ecology, and hydrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position serves to establish and consolidate near-range remote sensing capacities in our research group and integrate field-based research within the context of our research on drought impact monitoring and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will plan and perform a drone-based surface reflectance remote sensing campaign for water stress detection in Swiss forests. You will analyse data and lead publications on vegetation water stress relations across landscape-scale gradients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate must hold a Ph.D. degree in a relevant field. Experience in drone-based remote sensing with completed training in the operation of UAVs, ideally with license, experience in managing field campaigns, and experience with close-range remote sensing data post-processing are required. The candidate should demonstrate proficient English written and oral skills. We expect a collaborative mentality and enthusiasm for the development of our computational infrastructure and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-offer&#34;&gt;We offer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer the candidate to be part of a growing group with a strong collaborative philosophy and and a tight international network of leading partners, providing further career development opportunities toward future academic or industry positions. You will benefit from a supporting academic environment and from the attractive quality of life in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to receiving your online application including the following documents: Motivation letter (max. 2 pages, with a statement of research interests and demonstrated experience with software development projects), a CV, copies of academic qualifications and the names and e-mail addresses of three referees. Please note that we exclusively accept applications submitted through our online application portal. Applications via email or postal services will not be considered. We continue recruitment until a suitable candidate is found. The start of this position is at your earliest convenience. The position is offered for one year with possibility for continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
